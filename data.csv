,,Louie the Italian Jew,Audio demonstration,15 May 2010,5.0 ,"This speaker has more bass than the Altec Lansing Music Speaker , which I also own. If you want to go that extra mile and spend a little more for a richer bass experience, I recommend this speaker."
,,Randall Paradiso,"Hardworking, Portable Speaker with Rich Sound",01 Jun 2016,5.0 ,"I needed an affordable, hardworking, portable speaker to use with my mobile electronic devices. After multiple searches, I decided to purchase this Altec Lansing iM227 Orbit MP3 Speaker . I have been absolutely pleased with the performance of this handy little speaker during my 5 years (and counting) of ownership! The speaker itself is lightweight, compact and easy to carry, sliding effortlessly into a tote bag for travel. I was genuinely surprised by the sound which emanates from the speaker. From an audiophile standpoint, the sound is surprisingly clear, with clear bass and treble tones. The rich sound generated is free from hiss, popping or static. Granted, it isn't going to have the sound of a large, powered speaker, but for the sake of portability, this thing is awesome! The male corded headphone jack plug, while on the short side, wraps conveniently around the underside of the speaker. The male end snaps into a clever slot, eliminating the possibilty of damage. Batteries are easy to replace. I have used both rechargable and regular batteries in this item with equal success. I get approximately 17 hours of use with rechargable batteries and around 19 hours of use with regular, better quality batteries. (Disregard the cheap ones shown in my product photo!) One caveat: the power button, located on the outside upper rim of the speaker, can be accidentally pushed to ""on"" when this speaker is traveling. I know from experience this will kill the batteries very quickly. My solution is to remove one battery and put in back into the unit going the wrong direction. When I arrive at my destination, I simply remove the backward battery and replace it in its proper direction."
,,Kevin K.,Works fine but the batteries that came with it were dead,09 Feb 2017,4.0 ,"The speaker sounds good. I plugged it into my Samsung S5 and there was no distortion at the highest volume, which I was happy about. The new batteries that were in it's original new seal were dead on arrival. Even with an expiration date of March 2018. I wasn't too happy about that. Good thing I had 3 AAA batteries of my own. The model number is confusing. Original sealed packaging say's it's the (IMT227), but the back of the speaker omits the ""T"". (IM227). Looks like they are the same thing, but are from two different production lines. In the description it say's it's an MP3 speaker for the IM227. This is why I didn't go to another seller who was selling the IMT227, because it didn't say MP3. It was $10 more here at $79 thinking I'm getting the MP3 version. They are both MP3. I feel like I was tricked by the description, and I could have saved $10 by going with the other seller if I had known this before. I feel like I'm being more than generous by giving this 4 stars."
,,russell,A source of confusion,28 Jun 2011,3.0 ,"I knew I wanted one of the Altec Orbits series speakers. The question was, which one? I had settled, for all the right reasons, on the IM-237. Or so I thought. When I actually went to purchase it I noted a window that said there was a newer model of the item. A newer model? The window suggested the IM-227. So the first odd thing, not many model numbers are retrogrades. Did it have different features? Was it improved? As it turns out the answer is much simpler. Altec found a way to make another buck or two by not including the case. Which is kind of drag because I think the case would actually be useful. Soundwise, the Altec IM-227 is a good value for $20 or so. It's not stereo, it's a single speaker. The tiny amplifier powered by three AAA batteries (which you supply) is fairly clean for what it is. Make no mistake, this is close listening device. You won't entertain others with this thing. It works at a desk, in a cubical or a small room with no background noise. I can see where it would be great for camping though I haven't checked the full length of the battery life claimed by Altec (24 hours). For a single driver speaker of this size the sound is rich, detailed and reasonably accurate (given the device). I think it's worth $20 if your needs match what this speaker does. Downsides: -The cord is short. I mean short. I'm talking seven inches of short. -It's very simply constructed of plastic. -It's not very cool looking. -Max volume isn't loud. -Power button gets turned accidentally if packed with other things (I pack mine without the batteries after learning this). -That skinny little cord is going to break and then this thing will be a throwaway (which is sad). Upsides: -It's cheap. -The sound is rich and reasonably accurate. -It's light. -It's small."
,,firebomb,A solid unit for compact aplications.,12 Aug 2015,4.0 ,"Pretty tough unit, so far I've had it buried under stuff in a backpack and the thing has very minimal discoloration and scratching, I keep it for grid failure or special situations where I need a sound boost. It offers pretty decent bass, and is better than my ipad and iphones built in speakers. It makes a difference. It's not my Sony Boom Box for sure, but it puts out when all else fails and uses easy to find batteries. Not a bad little unit, it won't fill up a noisy room, but it will make a clear loud statement wherever you're chilling with a decent amount of thump to the bass. The wire on it has held up too. my fear with any item that does not have a detachable cord is that it will fail and you're done. Good news is that's not the case, the thing has held up and still looks next to new months and months later after being lugged around outdoors in a backpack. If cost, portability, and easy to find batteries is your game along with decent sound this thing is your guy. Battery life is on point as well, outpreforms other units that take larger batteries, or are overall larger and outputs similar sound also giving you pretty good battery life. Space, battery life, sound quality ""slightly above medium on the quality bar"", is where it's at."
,,PWB Esq,"Small, Round and Amazing Sound",09 Jul 2012,5.0 ,"I bought these Altec Lansing iM237 Orbit ultra-portable speakers on 17 July 2011 for $22.90. I cannot believe they have gone up $24 in the ensuing year. I am not sure why they have gone up so much, nevertheless, they are excellent speakers. If I had not bought mine previously, I would have paid the $46.50 for which they are now selling. Why? Because they have rich sound with deep bass and nice treble. I am continually amazed at the sound that comes out of these speakers. The bass is rich and deep. I simply cannot believe that they are so small and pack such a punch. The treble is as good as the bass - I can hear the high tones as well as the bass. These speakers are small: about 2 inches high and 3 3/8 of an inch in diameter (it kind of looks like a big hockey puck). In addition, they are really quite simple: The speaker itself, a short 3.5 mm jack, and the On/Off button. That is all there is to these speakers. However, for such simplicity, they have amazing sound. They can easily fill up a 15x15 room and everyone would be able to hear the music playing with no problem. They will fit almost any place I want to sit them for play. This speaker is very loud. When I turn up my MP3 player all the way, it really blows me out of the room. It runs on 3 triple A batteries, which were included, placed in the bottom in a screw out base. I will have to say, I find it difficult to screw this cap back on once it is off. I am not sure why is unscrews so easily but is so difficult to get back on, but I have trouble in replacing this cap. It has an On/Off button on the side, with a green LED light to let me know that it is on (and draining the batteries). When the LED light turns red, I know that it is time to replace the batteries. This is quite a handy feature to have so I know when my batteries are dying. Otherwise, I would have to wait until the batteries actually died and then replace them - not a good scenario to be in with a dead speaker. The batteries last about 12 hours of continuous play. It has no volume control; rather you control the volume by the device it is hooked up to - be it an MP3 player, a computer or my smartphone or even a television if it has a 3.5 mm jack. This would be good if I have the gang over to watch the game and I wanted a speaker to fill the room. It comes with a gray case with the Altec Lansing logo on the top. The case is very foamy, and while it would not provide much protection in a drop, I do like putting it in the case after I am finished using it because it does protect it against dirt, water and other environmental factors. On the back of the case is a round loop with metal reinforcing it. It comes with a carabiner clip. I took this off simply because I didn't use it. Oh one thing I forgot to mention. On the side opposite the LED light, there is a slot that I can put a wrist strap on this unit. Over all, these speakers are excellent. I really enjoy using them - they have amazing sound, they are very simple and I can use them with a variety of devices."
,,Koko the Talking Ape,Sounds good when not howling (revised),26 Jun 2013,5.0 ,"This fellow is small, simple and cheap, all good things. When it works, it produces surprisingly good sound, loud enough to fill a room. It does not produce any bass at all, but for NPR or a little relaxation music while travelling, it is perfect, much better than the horrible clock radios in hotel rooms. It connects to anything with a 1/8"" socket, such as Android phones, most MP3 players and the little pocket FM radio that I was using. It doesn't even have a volume control; you use the control on your sound source. It doesn't have Bluetooth, but Bluetooth would cut battery life, add expense and possibly hurt the sound, without adding any real function. Not necessary. Unfortunately, it started making a loud static-y howling noise a few weeks after I bought it. It would start producing music fine, then after a few minutes, the howling would start. The howling would continue after you turned down the volume and even disconnected it. I would have to turn it off to make it stop. I eventually realized that the howling was caused by dying batteries. Replacing the batteries eliminates the problem. There is something weird about the amplification circuit that causes that, and it is something I have never seen in any of the dozens of pieces of electronics I have owned. It actually is a design flaw, but one that is easy to fix. Another small flaw is the silver paint, which will begin to scratch and wear off if it is tossed in your luggage. I have kept on the clear plastic sleeve it was shipped in, which looks fine. Some phones or small radios use the headphone cable as an FM antenna, and since this thing replaces the headphones and has only a eight-inch cord, you might need an extension cable to get good FM reception. (Of course, if you listen to MP3s, you won't need one.) All in all, a simple, effective, cheap product. I don't travel without it. It would also be great for laptop presentations, because it sounds better than laptop speakers or the speakers built into projectors."
,,Allen R. Beecham,Best sound when compared to 2 competitors.,03 Jul 2010,4.0 ,"Even though the internal speakers on my Sony Vaio notebook computer are decent, I sometimes need a little more volume and clarity. When the need arises, I usually whip out the ear-buds. But recently, I've been wanting to play some tunes on my computer at work where it's not convenient to wear ear-buds. Hence, the ""need"" for one of these portable mini-speakers. After reading the reviews on portable notebook/iPod/iPhone speakers, I narrowed my choice down to 3 products and ordered all 3. I thought that I would choose the best one, send the others back, and review them at the same time. So....my 3 choices were the X-Mini II Capsule Speaker , the iHome iHM60 Rechargeable Mini Speakers for iPod (Blue) , and the Altec Lansing iM-237 Orbit Ultraportable Speaker for MP3 Players (Silver) . I tested all 3 speakers with my Sony Vaio notebook, my iPhone 3Gs, and my 60-gig iPod. All 3 speakers worked with all 3 devices, and the rating results were comparable. One more thing: although 2 of the 3 speakers have USB charging cables, none of them are USB devices. The USB only charges the speaker; the sound is controlled via the headphone-out controls. 1) X-Mini II Capsule Speaker ---- This speaker is the most compact. I like the design, the lines, the feel, and the size. It just feels right. It looks like a little pill/capsule, and then springs open to reveal bellows that enhance the bass. The sound is focused and clear, but ranks #3 in loudness and bass quality. It is the only speaker of the 3 that I tested that has a volume control, but I really don't see the need for a volume control when the speaker is only 6 inches away from the sound source. It has a built-in speaker cord for when you want to run it on the internal rechargeable battery. There's also a combined USB charging/speaker cable....1 plug inserts into your computer USB port to charge the speaker battery, and the 2nd plug goes to the headphone-out on your computer (or iPod). So, if your speaker battery dies, just plug the 2 plugs into the computer and you're back up and running. If you're using the speaker to listen to your iPod or iPhone, you are out of luck if the speaker battery dies, unless you have a USB power source nearby. Unfortunately, both the attached speaker cable and the combined USB charging/speaker cable are very flimsy. It also has a speaker-out jack, which allows you to daisy-chain speakers together. Not really a huge selling point, since people tend to buy these speakers because they are small and compact...so who wants to carry 2 with them? But I suppose it does allow for more flexibiity, athough daisy-chaining 2-3 of these little guys together just doesn't make good financial sense. So, just like the volume control, the speaker-out jack is a non-issue to me. Also comes with a little carrying bag made of felt material. Pros --- Looks and feels right. Small/compact. Decent sound, considering it's size. Rechargeable battery. Option of using built-in cable or combined USB charging/speaker cable. Cons --- Worst performance in terms of loudness and bass (but still not bad). Flimsy cables. 2) iHome iHM60 Rechargeable Mini Speakers for iPod (Blue) ---- This speaker is very similar to the X-Mini II above. The major differences: it's larger than the X-Mini and doesn't look as ""polished"". It doesn't have a volume control, but who needs one anyway? It doesn't have a built-in cable....it only has a USB charging/speaker cable....but it's MUCH sturdier than the cable on the X-Mini. The sound is louder and fuller, with more pronounced bass.....probably because the diameter is bigger and the bellows are longer. Comes with a medium-heavy duty black carrying bag, which is more substantial than the felt used for the X-Mini II bag. Also has a speaker-out jack, just like the X-Mini II, for daisy-chaining speakers together. Pros --- Ranks #2 in loudness and bass. Small/compact. Rechargeable battery. Sturdy cable. Nicer carrying bag. $10 cheaper than the X-Mini. Cons --- Less ""polished"" look/feel. Not as small as the X-Mini. No built-in speaker cable, so you MUST use the more bulky USB charging/speaker cable. 3) Altec Lansing iM-237 Orbit Ultraportable Speaker for MP3 Players (Silver) --- This speaker is the largest, but weighs about the same as the IHome. It has NO USB charging cable....just a built-in speaker cable. It ONLY runs on 3 AAA batteries. I haven't used it long enough to test the battery life. The carrying case is a deluxe zippered case that really protects the speaker. It also includes a lanyard for the speaker and a little caribiner clip for the case. The sound clearly out-classes the other 2 in loudness, clarity, and bass. Pros --- Best sound of the 3. Uses 3 AAA batteries (no rechargeable battery to die on you). Built-in speaker cable. Very nice carrying case. Cons --- Largest of the 3. Uses 3 AAA batteries (rechargeable battery is convenient, but they often die.) Flimsy built-in speaker cable. So.....which one am I keeping? That's a good question. I'm DEFINITELY returning the X-Mini II. It performed the worst of the 3, it has flimsy cables, and it costs as much as the Altec. Although the iHome requires that you use the bulkier combo-cord, it sounds better and costs $10 less than the X-Mini II. No-brainer. How about the Altec? It sounds the best, but has some limitations. I might keep BOTH the Altec and the iHome. But I'm DEFINITELY keeping the iHome, which is the all-around winner in this speaker shoot-out when you compare sound, price, and features. A couple more remarks. The iHome packaging is maddening. The speaker is wire-tied into the package, making it extremely difficult to remove. I ended up essentially destroying the packaging in order to remove the speaker. But perhaps iHome did that on purpose, so as to discourage returns. Very annoying, but not a deal-breaker. Also, the iHome's cable has a hard plastic clip attached that is supposed to be used as a wire-tie. I have very good manual dexterity, but I was unable to fold the cable back up and clip it back together. Nice try, iHome, but the velcro cable-tie of the X-Mini II is a much better design.....too bad they decided to include such a flimsy cable. I hope this review helps you in your purchase of a portable speaker for your notebook computer or iPod/iPhone. Be sure to check out my VIDEO REVIEW, which includes sound bytes from all 3 speakers.

,,Greg,Altec Lansing iM227 Orbit compared to iHome IM60.,11 Jan 2018,4.0 ,"I bought the Altec Lansing iM227 Orbit, and the iHome IM60. The Altec Lansing uses three AAA batteries (not 2 like the specs say), and the iHome is USB rechargeable. Here is my comparison of them. The Altec Lansing was running of Vista at 50% volume, and the iHome was driven off Windows 10 at 100% volume. I use the Altec Lansing at home where AAA batteries are easy to come by, and the iHome at work, where they aren't."
,,J,Big in size and sound,19 Apr 2012,5.0 ,"Decided on this over the X-Mini II (which my daughter owns and is a decent speaker), and the iHome iHM60GT. Had first hand experience with the X-Mini and played with the iHome in a local store. However, as good as they sounded, they just didn't have enough ""oomph"" for me. Although certainly acceptable, they were both a tad too flat and generic for my tastse. They are certainly suitable for a dorm room, work desk, or night stand. After researching, the general consensus seemed to be that the Altec Lansing had the best sound, so I bought it, based strictly on the reviews of my fellow Amazon reviewers, without first hearing it, so I didn't know what to expect. When it arrived, it was a lot larger than I expected. I knew it was larger than the other two based on reviews, however, I was still a bit surprised after seeing it in person the first time. After slicing through the frustration-full packaging (Altec's blister pack, not the Amazon packing), with a box cutter, I popped in three AAA batteries (not included) and connected it to my iPod Classic. I've owned it for about a month and have to say I like it. I rate it five stars compared to similar devices (like the X-Mini and iHome), not higher-end iPod music docks or other more capable products. This is perfect for the same tasks as the other two: dorm rooms, office desks, nightstand (although most would likely prefer more performance, like a dock with alarm clock capabilities). So far, I've played every genre of music imaginable except Classic. I've played Jay-Z, Rammstein, The Yellowjackets, Fourplay, Mark Ronson, LMFAO.... All of it sounded pretty good for such a (large) tiny speaker. It's perfect for lazy evenings on the back porch with a cigar, a beverage and an MP3 player loaded with every album imaginable. Well, that's MY perfect (and usual) scenario, but any situation where you need a nice moderate music player without too much ruckus yet decently deep lows and crisp highs, this will do it. If you need a room-filler for small parties or gatherings, get something louder."
,,D-T-D,Best portable speaker,06 Oct 2012,4.0 ,"I looked at other portable speakers and ended up with Altec Lansing iM227 and never regretted it. Sound quality is good for the price you are paying. The volume is loud enough for phone/tablet/laptop use. AAA batteries was the main reason I chose iM227 over its competitors. See, if you have built-in rechargeable battery, the speaker is much smaller. But there are some drawbacks. Once the battery is drained, you cannot use the speaker until it's recharged. And once the battery has reached its life, you have to throw the speaker away. (The cost of replacing battery is likely comparable with the speaker, unless you're replacing it yourself.) .... and finally, you have to carry yet another charger/cable for your speaker. Despite iM227 being larger than its competitors, the fact that it accepts standard AAA batteries made up for it. It ensures continuous use (as long as I have another set of batteries around), and guarantees that it will be useful long after the manufacturer decides not to support it. I have been using this speaker with 2 sets of 3xEneloops and am very satisfied with it. Unless better competition comes along, I wouldn't hesitate to purchase iM227 again. But as everything in this world, nothing is perfect. Here's a list : - Audio cable is too short. I had to buy an extension cable for it. From its design, I suspect that the audio cable with be the first part to give out - Just when the battery has barely enough juice to power the speaker, it will make an annoying/loud buzz until the battery is dead or until you turn the speaker off. - Battery compartment contacts are sensitive. Do not drop it with batteries installed. - When packed in a suitcase/luggage, be sure to take at least one battery out. - Why 3 AAAs? I know there's a technical limitation behind it, but I'd rather use 2 AAAs instead. See, AAAs always come in even number, and it messes up my rechargeables setup. :) - Never crank up to 85-100% volume. That guarantees noise. The manual mentioned it, but I wish the speaker could handle this situation better."
,,Malia M.,"great so far, Addressing issues",07 Dec 2011,5.0 ,"I bought this product to replace an $8 mini speaker. So I cannot compare it to mini speakers in the same price range. I was thinking of buying another brand, if so I will return to make this comparison. I bought this after comparing about 500 five star reviews to 50 one star reviews. Some complained about trouble closing the battery compartment. You twist the cap off the bottom to open this area. There are slots on either side of the cap which secure it to the base. You can not secure the cap if the slots are reversed. The slot position is correct if you can wrap the cord around the back and clip it into the 'mold'. Once again, I have not owned it long enough to talk about battery life issues. I bought rechargeable batteries that I can recharge over night, but hopefully I do need to. Others say the speaker makes noises. Maybe its to early for me to hear these screeching noises, maybe other five star reviewers posted prematurely as well. But I know that this speaker, or any speaker, will malfunction if the sound is too loud. Make sure that you use the speaker as recommended: keep the volume under 85%, and do not use an equalizer. This issue could be the result of user error. I hope to update if anything changes. UPDATE: The speakers began to screech while playing. Conditions: Device volume set at 2/3(20/30) . Does not screech at lower volume level (5/30). Green light is now red. So once again, people are complaining about this loud screeching issue. Based on the conditions, I believe it is the battery level. High volume = more battery use; Low battery = Screech sound"
,,Richard P. Willey,Boldly moving into the 21st Century!,21 Jun 2011,5.0 ,"I've been wanting to get into the 21st century in terms of my music system that I take camping for a long time now. Let's face it; hauling around a boom box, cases of CD's and enough batteries to sink a battleship gets old pretty fast. I read all the reviews on external speaker for mp3 players that I could find and the Altec Lansing iM-237 Orbit Ultraportable Speaker for MP3 Players got the best ones. So I placed an order and it came in this morning and I couldn't wait to test it out. This little speaker is amazing and it's just what I was looking for, it's small, lightweight and it's more that loud enough for playing music while camping. After all, I'm camping not staging a rave! I'm curious about usage in terms of the battery life, and will update my review after it's made it first trip into the wilderness. I also noted in one of the reviews about the mono issue and buying two speakers and getting a splitter. I'm not sure that is going to be an issue for me personally, but I have made a mental note about it anyway, you never know. All I know is I've gone from having to haul a storage box full of stuff to having a system I can literally carry in one hand. You have to admit, the 21st century is pretty cool! Update: Just came back from a week camping trip and I can now report that this little Altec speaker is the bomb! We never had to turn the volume on it all the way up to hear the music at all. The batteries lasted the whole week of daily use without being taken out every night and never needed to be replaced. I simply am overjoyed in having found it and look forward to many years of use with it. To say I highly recommend it is overstating the obvious! Bye-bye boom box!"
,,EscapeVelocity,One of the Loudest Available,25 Feb 2013,4.0 ,"Pros Louder than most Stable form factor - doesnt bounce around or roll over Longer cord than most - almost twice as long as most Power Button with On/Off indicator light Runs on 3 user replaceable AAA batteries - Use LSD NiMH (Eneloops) and you have a rechargeable user replaceable solution Easy access to battery compartment Cord stores away easily and intuitively Good protection of the driver - protects it from jabs and pokes in your backpack Not a battery hog - pretty easy on the batteries, lots of playtime on a set of alkalines Cons Build quaity - not bad, but could use better materials for the cord thickness and lower plastic frame (they might have cheapened it down from the earlier IM237) Sound quality - a bit thin and tinny sounding, some distorition at highest volume, but pretty good compared to the competition Size - bigger than most others, but this isnt that big of a deal Cord length - even though it is almost twice as long as most, and you can get an extension cord for it, it could stand to be 4"" longer Other products Ive used... X-Mini II Music Bullet Various high quality headphones Various audiophile home and car audio systems - I like vintage equipment Very satisfied with the purchase. Highly recommended. I suffered severe hearing loss and no longer can use headphones. And my listening enjoyment of audiophile gear is severely impaired having everything go through hearing aids now. I use this to augment the nearly imperceptable noises coming out of my laptop integrated speakers and it allows me to access news video clips and listen to music well. The extra volume that this produces over the X-Mini II and Music Bullet makes a difference. I had the X-Mini II for a while and then damaged the cord due to it's thinness combined with rough handling while attached and the very short cord. This is an improvement all the way around over the X-Mini II for me. I also picked up a Music Bullet (As Seen on TV) and I will be keeping that one too. Look for my review on Amazon of the Music Bullet. Long story short...I like the USB rechargeable lithium-ion battery and the extra long (twice as long again as the Altec Lansing IM227) RETRACTABLE cord. The long cord is invaluable...that it is retractable in a quick and seemling quite sturdy mechanism is a delight! The Music Bullet's sound quality and volume doesnt match the X-Mini II, but these ease of use features more than make up for the slight difference. one thing I dont like about the Music Bullet is the lack of protection for the driver....it is open to abuse with not even open bars of the X-Mini. Im gonna keep them both. The reason why the ability to get loud is so important (other than my hearing impairment) is that even though it distorts at full volume on most sources of audio (Youtube and the like)....it gives you the extra flexibility to listen to Video clips with poor audio levels at decent sound levels (and without distorting). This is why the Altec Lansings loudness advantage over other similar devices is so desireable. I would have given this 4 and 1/2 stars but couldnt bring myself to give it 5 stars because there is room for improvement. That being said. I highly recommend the Altec Lansing IM227 Orbit. It is one of the best of it's class. Other products considered... iHome iHM60 Kinivo ZX100 iTour Pop = Nearly purchased this one for it's Sound Quality (3w amp, loudness, and lower distortion) but the short cord and busy pop up design led me to the simplicity of the Altec Lansing If you found my review helpful please click the Yes button below. UPDATE: It's only been a few months and the thin cord is damaged at the plug. It is a week spot. Shame, because the unit got a lot of things right. I would improve the sturdiness of the plug and also the battery cover, which isnt terrible but could be a little better implemented for battery changes in low lighting."
,,Michael Maryland,"Great little speaker, but not perfect.",24 Aug 2012,5.0 ,"Some might prefer a portable speaker with an internal rechargeable battery, but I like being able to use my own rechargeable AAA batteries. I have purchased multiple Eneloop rechargeables and like that I can replace them if need be. There is no volume control. This is a bit of a bummer, but honestly you just do not need one as you have a volume switch on your device. My only real issue with this product is the cord. It is small and thin. It feels like it could easily get yanked out. I would almost just prefer it had an aux port instead so I could use my own cord. This unit is a bit bigger than the competition. As far as the sound goes, its really good. I had someone momentarily fooled into thinking my Klipsch 2.1 computer speakers were playing. You obviously cannot compare this with a 2.1 system, but it puts out nice rich sound at all but the highest volume. Given its size, only the craziest audiophile could be upset with its sound. The company claims 24 hour battery life. So far I am on about 8 hours and have not had to change them. I am loving everything about this thing other than the suspect cord. Im interested to see a new model, but I highly recommend this."
,,Matt,Portable Audio: Altec Lansing iM237 Orbit Speaker,05 May 2013,4.0 ,"I needed a portable speaker for playing tunes from my phone when I was outdoors doing yardwork, or when I was shooting baskets or playing racquetball. The Altec Lansing iM237 was highly rated and one of the most popular products available, so I gave it a shot. It really is portable, about the size of 2 hockey pucks stacked together. It is extremely light, and takes 3 AAA batteries. It includes a lightly padded carrying case which is essential. The sound itself is as advertised, loud and powerful, and the cable to connect to your device (3.5mm) is conveniently tucked and wrapped around the bottom of the unit. All in all, I was very happy with the speaker and MOST of its design. I do have some criticisms however. The cable is quite short, and this can be a hassle when trying to use the device it is attached to. Obviously you can get an extender (which I suggest) but I would have liked a tad more length. Also, the power button is a slight issue. Sometimes it just gets turned on from pressure against it when it is in the case, and this of course drains your batteries. My third main criticism is durability. I admit I used my speaker pretty often, but within a year and a half (conveniently out of warranty) the power button simply stopped working. The connections were fragile, and even attempting to do some minor cobbling repairs did not get the job done, and the power button simply stopped working. However, I liked the product enough to order it's newer version the MI227, which is basically the same unit. So if you're in the market for a portable speaker, the AL IM237/227 is great: be aware there are a couple drawbacks, be careful with the power button, and get ready to rock out."
,,Celia Bauer,Solved the static noise that bad reviews complained about,07 Feb 2011,4.0 ,"I read a lot of reviews for this speaker, including bad ones complaining of horrible static, but decided to give it a try. I wanted a portable speaker for my ipod touch so I could listen to podcasts and easily move from room to room at home without being tangled in earphones or having to unplug from the wall. I've had it for a week now and have decided to keep it. When I first got it and plugged it into my ipod, it made terrible crackling static noise. I thought I got one of the duds because it was doing what the bad reviews complained about. Then the crackling would come and go. So I started experimenting and figured out the problem...static electricity. All winter I've noticed static crackling a little in my earphones when I put on or took off my very static-charged bathrobe but it wasn't loud or bothersome. This speaker is a little more sensitive and WHOLE LOT LOUDER when it gets near static electricity. I hadn't realized how dry it is in my home with electric heat running. The day after I got the speaker, I put it in the bathroom with the door closed while I showered, creating high humidity. The static problem disappeared. So I'm running a humidifier and I fiddle with the speaker and wire every day to make sure I don't have a dud. Works well and sounds good now, no crackling at all. So the speaker doubles as humidity gauge. This speaker has great output with music for the size. With spoken word pod casts it's fine usually but leaves me wanting a little more volume sometimes when I'm listening in the shower. I like that I can carry the speaker and ipod in one hand. I've used it everyday for a week and batteries that came with it are still strong. For the price and portability, I'm happy."
,,T. Poole,good speaker,31 Mar 2012,5.0 ,"Daughter used this for dance/drill team tryouts. Needed a way to use her ipod Nano attached to a speaker and be 10 or more feet from the speaker(so you can dance and not step on, kick, etc the ipod and speaker) and still be able to ""hear"" the music. They go from house to house during tryout week, and you never know if you will have a CD player, or if you have to be outside to practice or what, so having a small portable speaker was what we needed. I had purchased another product in the same price range, and don't know if it was defective or not but at it's loudest, you could lay your ear on the speaker to get ""a quiet/normal volume."" I was disappointed in that one. 2 feet away and you could't hear the music. So I ordered this one based on the fact that it had ""loud volume"" that was needed for our purpose and it worked great. Haven't had it long, so can't comment on durability, battery life, etc...but it has now been outside while the girls sunned, and it worked in that situation just fine. Good speaker for the price...and like that it is compact. The wire to connect the ipod is not long, but is long enough, and it wraps around pegs underneath to keep it neat. This is not a super loud ""booming"" speaker, but it is sufficient for the girls to learn their dances to when they are on their own."
,,EssJayKay,"LOUD, just like I was looking for",12 May 2012,5.0 ,"I have used some other portable speakers, such as iHome speaker docks for use with an iPhone, but have always been very unsatisfied with the volume output. This unit is smaller than any I have tried, is very light and portable, and doesn't seem to run through batteries. It also gets LOUD! Obviously it's not going to compare with a stereo speaker system, but for such a portable unit, it really is wonderful. I do have some mixed feelings about the built in Aux cable. On one hand, it is really nice that it has one, and even better that it tucks into the bottom of the unit where it sits relatively protected. On the other hand, the cable itself is very short which limits the way I use it to some degree. If you just want it to sit in place with an iPod attached, then great, no problem! But when I try to hold my iPad on my lap to use music apps like GarageBand, sometimes it's awkward to find a place to put the speaker within the 9"" range the cord provides. If the unit had an AUX jack instead of or in addition to a hard wired cord, this logistical issue would be solved. I recognize that this is a very minor issue though, so haven't deducted any stars from my overall review. I have had no complaints about the clarity of the sound, even at higher volumes. The bass is a bit lacking as one might expect from a small unit, but I haven't encountered any buzzing sounds from more bass-heavy songs. Overall I am extremely happy with this device!"
,,Comdet,"Great sound, nice Fire addition, but weak cord",16 Dec 2011,4.0 ,"Overall, I'm pleased with this speaker. It hits the mark where it counts the most -- great sound. It makes the audio output of the Kindle Fire sound SO much better! I also like that it runs on removable batteries. Many of the other small speakers I looked at had an internal rechargeable battery. While that has some advantages, the fact that the Fire does not have a USB port means I'd have to charge them from an outlet (with an adapter) or on my PC. Plus, non-removable batteries can present a problem when they fail. The Altec Lansing uses 3 AAA batteries which are far easier to deal with. I still use rechargeables (either Eneloops or the Amazon Basic rechargeable) and get several hours of play time per charge. The shortcomings relate to the cord. It's short (about 8 inches) and is very thin. It would be a much better product with a longer cord (about 12 inches) and a cord that's made of more substantial material. I can see the cord being a potential point of failure down the road due to its lightweight construction. But overall, it's a good device and a great value (if you catch it on a price dip). Highly recommend as an add-on to the Fire."
,,Taterbug,Does the job!,18 Jul 2012,4.0 ,"I ordered this speaker because face it, speakers in these small devices aren't large enough or powerful enough most of the time. I am also 90% deaf in my right ear so this speaker was exactly what I was looking for. It really cranks up the volume for it's small size. Don't expect a PA system or large in-home stereo sound but expect to hear a clear sound and even bass frequencies. The speaker cord is too short in my opinion and the battery cover is awkward to remove and replace batteries. I don't think they are worth $30 but more like $20 or a bit more. They do however come with the 3 batteries for the unit and the name Altec has never let me down. We used their speakers back in the 1980's for our hard rock band's PA system and they were quality then and now. I suggest buying these if you're hard of hearing. Really helped me. Also follow the directions on how to adjust the volume. It recommends setting your device at 85 to 90% of it's volume and to disable the bass boast on the EQ setting. Not sure yet how the batteries will hold out but it makes sense that the longer it's played at a high volume it will consume them faster! ...Amazon also got them to me fast as usual!"
,,RF,Great little speaker,04 Feb 2017,5.0 ,"this is the best sounding small speaker you could imagine. I got this speaker when it first came out for $11.00. that's not a typo. eleven dollars! I kick myself every time I remember that. I should have bought more; like 10 more. I've had it for 2 years now and use it every day sitting on the dash of the truck I drive. sounds as good as it always has. I bought a little blue-tooth signal receiver that I plug on to it, so no extension wire to mess with. if it ever goes up on me, I guess i'll have to spend $100 on a new one. I'm too spoiled now to accept a lesser sounding speaker."
,,Cow Byte,Always gets a surprised look!,02 Mar 2012,4.0 ,"I've been using this for a few months now. Ordered this to use for my Zune since I'm using another portable speaker for my laptop. It gives a pretty hefty sound, although it's a little larger and bulkier than the X-Mini capsule speaker that I use for my laptop (http://www.amazon.com/X-Mini-II-Capsule-Speaker-Black/dp/B001UEBN42/ref=sr_1_6?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1330696839&sr=1-6) I remember bringing it out and connecting it to a friend's laptop while we were watching some videos on youtube. They were shocked at the sound quality of what looked like a non-stereo speaker. I've done it multiple times with my laptop and my Zune, It's always fun to see. A friend of mine wanted to buy one online immediately after he heard it. I leave it connected to my Zune, and it's pretty portable. Pros: Good sound, portable, looks decent. Sound is surprisingly good. Cons: No volume control, takes double-a batteries that drain easily if you don't turn off the thing. It's easy to forget to turn off, and the power button isn't really easy to depress. (The double-a battery can be a plus however, since it doesn't require another power source and it's easily replaceable!) Compared with the X-Mini, I think this gets more sound, but the X-Mini has a volume control option that I like a lot. The X-Mini is also a lot more portable since it screws into a tiny little ball. I take the X-Mini around with me in my laptop bag. I probably could take the Altec with me, but I have a more portable option so I go with that."
,,Lotus flower mama,Worth MORE than the piddly price I paid!,27 Apr 2011,5.0 ,"So all I wanted was a simple speaker that I could attach to my ipad so that I could more easily listen to my music (without headphones) or watch movies/videos with my daughter while sitting at the kitchen counter (or wherever), since the internal speaker on the ipad is okay in quiet rooms, but really can't compete with much external noise. I did my research for several hours (as I always do) and debated back and forth between this and a couple of other small/portable speakers. I finally chose this one because of (a) all of the good reviews, and MOSTLY (b) it was the ONLY portable speaker I found that used REGULAR BATTERIES instead of a USB charger, and I thought that, especially with any kind of travel (and possibly no access to a computer), that would be a LOT more useful. Well, I made the right choice! I couldn't believe how much this little thing amplified my ipad's speaker, and that IT ACTUALLY SOUNDS GOOD! (I even listen to some very bass-y music, and it does fine!) Now, if you're a freakish audiophile and very fussy about how your speakers sound, go for some $$$$ Bose speakers. But if you just want to listen to some music and/or watch movies or videos and simply enjoy yourself AND get a GREAT bargain at the same time, GO FOR THESE - you WON'T be sorry! Oh, and I've used the batteries for many hours now, and have yet to chew through them!"
,,Lionel B.,Nice sound quality - uses AAA batteries,29 Nov 2011,5.0 ,"I use this speaker quite a bit with my Galaxy Note and Kindle Fire when watching movies and listening to music. I got these cheap for $14. I have a couple of them. Pro: - The sound quality is pretty decent with soft added bass. I would rate it 9/10 for sound quality - I like the small size very much which makes this mini-speaker an easy travel companion. It measures 2"" in height and 3-3/8"" in diameter. - I like the fact it uses 3 AAA batteries - I get over 20 hours on a set of batteries. If you have other battery gadgets, I would recommend using good rechargeable batteries - be sure to get a good charger that can measure the mAh of your batteries such as the La Crosse Technology BC-700 Alpha Power Battery Charger - pricey but well worth it in the long run. Con: - The cable attachment from the speaker to your device is rather short. This makes it inconvenient to pick up your device (to adjust something) without also moving the speaker. To solve this, I got a 3.5mm m/f extension adapter which allows me more freedom. - Has only a power on/off button. No volume button. Overall: - I enjoy the added sound quality the speaker provides - no regrets for a $14 speaker. (I noticed it now sells for $21 which reduces their value. For that price I would have rated it a 4 star) PS: If you are looking for a bluetooth AAA battery mini-speaker you may want to look at the Memorex MA3911MS Portable Wireless Bluetooth Speaker with Microphone . This speaker is a lot more expensive at $45 and the sound quality is slightly less crisp than the Altec. The trade-off for bluetooth is fine by me but then I am more of a movie buff than a music buffs."
,,Roger R. Stoffel,great for a small tv,11 Jan 2013,5.0 ,"I've used this small speaker for over a year now, and for what I got it for it works great. Replaced a small kitchen tv with a 21"" cheap flat screen with poor tinny sounding speakers (cannot expect much in sound from a small flat screen since there's not enough room for a good sounding speaker). Hooked up this Altec Lansing speaker to the tv and it sounds just like the old tv speaker. Of course it's in mono, and there is no booming bass, but sounds, especially voices, are crisp and clear; it works fine in a kitchen. It does not flat out at all if turned up louder when I'm doing something noisey in the kitchen, and it can be heard clearly in other rooms. I did have to supplement the short chord (I think it is only 6"" long) with an inexpensive extension. Runs about 40-50+ hours on 3-AAA batteries, assuming you turn it off after use; that's where the green ""on"" light comes in handy...it ""reminds"" you that it is still on. The green light turns to red when the batteries get low, but I found out you can go at least another 10 hours on red, so don't rush to replace the batteries...you'll get some loud short bursts of static-y noise when they actually need replacing."
,,MaxS,Small but powerful,25 Aug 2013,4.0 ,"In a nutshell, this thing is pretty loud. The shape itself isn't super portable, as it's a large round cylinder. If you can imagine a cylindrical package of ice breakers, stack two of them up, and that's the size of the 227 speaker. 3 AAA batteries run it for a fairly long time, and there's no other way to power this unit. It's not bad, but even a micro/mini usb might have been nice, although this wouldn't be an upgrade over a laptops own built in speakers. Compared to my MBP, the speaker is slightly bassier and fuller, but not louder or so much better that you'd use it for laptop speakers. It is however much louder than my iPad or iPhone, as well as sounding better. And that's why you buy this unit. I use this with my iPad when I'm watching something in the kitchen, or if I need to workout in the gym or do stuff in the garage, I can hook it up to my iPhone. The cord that comes with the 227 wraps around the bottom of the unit, which is also where you access the battery compartment. The cord is shirt, about 6in. It's a good size for connecting to a phone or tablet, but if you pick up the phone or tablet a lot, it gets a little annoying. Buying an extension cord would work, but then you need to carry that too. The cord, and the lack of an alternate power source are the main reasons I gave it 4 stars. I'd probably have gone 4.5 stars if it was possible. Bottom line, for 20 dollars, you really can't go wrong."
,,Jesse Walker,Blew me away. *WAY* better than iHome iHM9U,21 Dec 2011,5.0 ,"I hesitated to buy this speaker, since I already had an external speaker for my mp3 player. But I was never really happy with the iHome iHM9U I had. It had been an impulse buy a couple years ago. When I plugged this Altec product in, I really wish I hadn't waited so long. No comparison between the sound. The iM227 is much louder, much clearer sound. Richer tones, and everything else about it just rocked. Rather than sounding muffled, it filled the room with decent sound. Yes, my home theater system is still nicer, but this Orbit speaker sounds more like it than like the dumb little pansy speaker I had before. And it's smaller, and easier to transport. What's not to love? I'm convinced this is the best product available for anywhere near this price. Just get it, you won't regret it. UPDATE: There's another (newer?) model of this product that includes 3 AAA batteries and an adapter that will connect the unit to devices with a 2.5mm plug (this model doesn't include batteries or the adapter). And, it's cheaper than this listing on Amazon (right now). I believe that other than those extra included items, it's an identical product. Check out the Altec Lansing Technologies IMT227 OrbitM Ultra Portable Speakers . I'd suggest getting that instead."
,,Jacob Roggero,"Wonderful Speaker, small ultra portable, clear and crisp sound",06 Sep 2013,5.0 ,"I have read some of these reviews that indicate that there is a high pitch screeching or that the speaker stops working if too high. I think there might be a case in which some of these speakers are defective. I have never experienced a single issue with mine which I have now owned for two years. I didn't use it much at all the first year or so that I owned it, and I didn't like that it was only battery powered. I have taken it on trips to the beach, in backpacks and camping and I think the sounds is great. This is a small speaker so it doesn't put out a ton of sound, and if you are in a very loud area and need to have this at full volume the sound will be distorted. The last few months I have been using this as a speaker at work and I must say that it works perfectly for that. I plug my cell phone in or use the computer and for playing music or video clips I think the sound is great. On heavy music with very high highs, or lots of bass I think you'll lose some audio quality, but you have to remember it's a single inexpensive speaker. For must uses I think the sound is deep and rich. Even after two years the sound quality is great and it has held up very nicely cosmetically. For a desk speaker, or travel companion I think most people would be pretty pleased."
,,John T. Sostak,"Good sound, works well with my iPhone 4",16 Jul 2012,3.0 ,"The Altec Lansing MP3 speaker is pretty good. It is about the size round of a beer can, but much shorter, about an inch and a half high. The sound is really good. I use it with an iPhone 4 and also a Sony transistor radio. It allows these small audio devices to be louder. It connects with a thin cable to the ear phone jack of the audio device. What I dislike about the speaker is the bottom where the 3 AAA batteries are housed. The battery cover and container are Mickey Mouse, poorly engineered. The batteries are mandatory to make this work, but seem to be an afterthought when designing this mp3 speaker. If you have this speaker and it isn't working, take the battery cover off and spin - wiggle the batteries. The speaker has a single power button, and a small red light next to it. If the light isn't on, it needs juice, which means the batteries are dead, or not making contact. The light is either green (good), red (batteries are low), no light (dead or no contact). Overall, this speaker is pretty good considering the price is low and the sound is good."
,,Amighty,At the beach and on the go,09 Jun 2010,4.0 ,"I specifically bought this to use at the beach with my iPhone. After looking at the other options, this really seemed like the best choice. My needs: a small speaker that I could conveniently use to pump out the tunes for my family/friends but wouldn't garner complaints from other beach-goers. Has to be small enough to take anywhere but still have respectable sound quality. It needs to be able to withstand the harsh sand and sun and have enough power to last all day, or at least take regular batteries. CHECK CHECK CHECK CHECK. This little baby is smaller than I thought it would be - about the size of a can of tuna. It's solidly built and the zippered case helps protect it on the go. The sound is just great (for what I could expect), and isn't distorted at the highest volume on the iPhone. I would say, on a normal beach day, you have a range of about 15 feet. The ONLY complaints I have are very minor - even just tweaks really. The cable could be a little longer, and the case could be just a hair bigger (it's hard to zip up if you have the lanyard attached). PROS: Small and lightweight Great build quality Included case, wrist-strap, and caribeaner battery powered, battery life respectable sound quality/volume price ($30 is close to best price for other similar items) No-nonsense operation (on/off switch) CONS: short cable case too snug ipod dock-connector would be a nice option (and also necessitate volume-control) People complain about the battery-cover, but once you figure out how it works it's really no big deal"
,,jimnypivo,"Little Speaker with Big, Clear Sound!",17 Nov 2014,5.0 ,"I've had this little speaker for quite a few years now, and I'm surprised I've waited this long to post a review. When I originally got it to boost my laptop's pitiful computer speakers, I thought I'd miss the 'stereo' sound you get with two speakers. But the sound is so loud and clear you don't miss the 'stereosity'. It does the job, amplifying the signal, whether it comes from my mp3 player, computer, cell phone or even my old Sony Walkman when listening to sports games. It comes with a protective case, and a thankfully short speaker wire interface. Batteries--whether rechargeable or alkaline, last a long, long time. I really can't say anything negative about the Altec Lansing Orbit speaker, except I don't know what I'd do without it!"
,,W. Cintron,Far exceeded my expectations.,16 Mar 2014,5.0 ,"This was a gift to be paired with a portable mp3 player for a friend, I did a great deal of research and decided this was the one. I was absolutely right. This speaker connects to a headphone jack via a small 1 foot cable that is built into a spool on its underside. Very good volume and sound quality, is a touch weak for delivering base-heavy music--but still no slouch. With the overall scope of service it's had (over a year now), I conclude it's an exceptional speaker for this size, and can be clearly heard in all neighboring rooms. It's quite the life of the party. The most inconvenient thing about it is the power source: 3 AAA batteries. Roughly 9-11 hours of play time before they need a charge. I use rechargeable Eneloops for this purpose. Be sure to have a quantity of batteries divisible by both 2 and 3 if you want the ability to recharge sets of them at a time for constant use."
,,B. Altemeyer,"Great Speaker, Great Price -first one I bought was twice as much.",06 Dec 2013,5.0 ,"I have the same model already for about 5 years and have only had two minor issues- I've had to use a tiny screwdriver to prop-out the battery contacts a few times- and the very small pin for the connectable wrist loop broke on my old one- however, I bought this one because my wife took my other one- and because a Phillips triangular speaker failed on me after only a few months. I'm happy in general with the Altec Lansing speaker, and if you want to make it recharge-able there are youtube videos on how to solder in a USB pig-tail which if used with rechargeable batteries would do exactly that- for me, I'm happy recharging batteries the old fashioned way- by popping them out of the device. one other note, occasionally it can be slightly tricky putting the back back on -it's not hard, it just rotates into place- but sometimes I have to try it a second time because of mis-aligning it the first time. I would buy this again and recommend it to anyone and everyone. -nice sound quality- and I get many comments about how loud it is given it's size. If I really need to Rock the House with a portable battery speaker I have a Roland Cube Street, that I can plug in my iPod. -but that is more Lug-able than Portable. -This little speaker is very portable."
,,riverguy,Very pleased with this unit!,14 Jan 2010,5.0 ,"I'm an audiophile, which means I'm pretty critical when it comes to speaker quality. I'll keep this short: You can believe all the good stuff you read about this little speaker and take the bad with a lot of skepticism. No, this speaker doesn't deliver the quality of sound I get from my $1200 Polk Audio units. But what I wanted was a speaker that would serve us some tasty background tunes when we're in hotel rooms, and that's exactly what I got. Placed across the room, the speaker fills the room with gentle sounds that are so sweet I don't even miss the fact that it is not stereo. It creates that ambient environment we wanted and does it well. There have been numerous complaints in these reviews about how the on/off switch is poorly designed and that it will turn itself on with even a slight bit of pressure when in the case supplied with the speaker. The cure is to place the speaker into the case with the switch at the back where the stiff hinge will protect the switch. I've tried to turn it on by squeezing the case right where the switch is, and it will not turn on that way. Problem solved. Others have complained about having to use alkaline batteries (3 AAAs). Yes, that's a trade-off, but I think I'd rather deal with the batteries than have yet one more gadget that needs to be plugged into a charger or a hot USB port. Anyway, this is the best deal for the money. I've bought lots of Altec Lansing components over the last 40 or so years and have never been let down. This one is no exception. Nice quality, looks like it would take a lot of use to ever hurt it. I've used it streaming radio programs on our Netbook and with any of several MP3 players. It works great with all of them."
,,Kindle Customer,big sound in a little package,03 Mar 2010,4.0 ,"I bought this to use with my mp3 and cd player. The cord is very short but for $4 (s&h included) I bought a 6' extension cord thru Amazon. The sound is good for what the product is. Of course, there are no sound adjustment options as are available on bigger units, but that is ok with me. I was wanting something to use while I am camping, on the patio, in the car (my car's cd player is broken), etc. As others have said, the case is a very tight fit. I really have to work at it to get the unit into the case. I don't have a problem with the unit being turned on (accidentally) while in the case though. However, most of the time I don't use the case. I can wrap my extension cord around the unit when not in use. Since I am using an extension cord I don't feel the need to completely unwrap the unit's cord, thereby solving the concern that the pressure on the short cord might over time make the wires break up close to the unit. I would suggest removing the batteries when not in use. I don't find the batteries hard to install or uninstall. This would prevent something which happened to me. While I was sleeping, the unit (which was on my nightstand) started buzzing very loudly (a rude awakening I can assure you!) because the batteries had run down. I have not tracked how long the batteries last. I use rechargeables. As I keep AAA rechargeables on hand for other items, I am not disturbed that it uses them instead of the AA batteries. Overall a nice product."
,,John Wilcox,Very Good Portable Speaker With Superior Sound Quality,06 Jul 2014,5.0 ,"I bought an iHome IM60GT 3.5 Aux Portable Speaker to use with my iPod, but after listening to my daughter's Altec Lansing speaker, I ended up purchasing the Altec Lansing iM227 Orbit MP3 Speaker. The Altec Lansing iM227's sound is much better than that of the iHome IM60GT's tinny speaker sound. The Altec Lansing takes three AAA-batteries, which seem to last forever. The iHome IM60GT has built-in rechargeable batteries, which are charged via an included USB-plug. And, for some reason, the Altec Lansing iM227 Orbit cost less than the iHome IM60GT. Now, I'm using the little iHome IM60GT speaker on my work computer, and the Altec Lansing iM227 Orbit is reserved for my iPod. It's also a great speaker to use with the iPhone, for those times you want to enjoy a YouTube video with friends."
,,Firstinlastout,Excellent punch from such a little speaker,12 Dec 2011,5.0 ,"I love this speaker....ultra portable, light and delivers a powerful punch from such a tiny piece of acoustical engineering. The only I wish was that the wire that connects to your MP3 device was longer. It's extremely short (about 6 inches) so it's difficult and sort of impossible to lift up your Kindle Fire (in my instance) and hold it in your hands to play, for example, Angry Birds. One would have to purchase a separate 3mm wire that is longer and that has a male to male adapator in order to have a longer cord. That is the other thing, I never knew it came with the wire to connect to your device. It does, although again...it's very short. I hope Altec Lansing creates this device in the future with a longer cord (at least 10 inches. Other than that....I LOVE IT. Best 20 bucks spent thus far. A true value. A big plus too is that it runs off it's own battery supply ( 3 AAA ) Someone last night at a holiday party commented to me that they had a portable speaker in the past that drew it's power directly from the power of the MP3 itself via the USB cable and that their MP3 device would always run out of power so quickly because of this. So for this to have it's own power supply (portable batteries thus far) is excellent. By the way, I have put in about 4 solid hours of playing this little beast and the batteries are still running strong."
,,Anthony S. Zorn,"improvement over previous version, one of the best out there!",08 Jan 2011,4.0 ,"I was an owner of the previous version of this unit, the iM207 orbit. It was a marvelous item with just a few minor problems (all of which have been corerected in this new version). I reviewed the previous versiona and just want to highlight for you why you should consider buying this item and why I am so happy with it. Many of us wish to have a portable speaker loud enough for a hotel room, bedroom, bathroom, a beach blanket, etc. a small to medium sized space. We especially are willing to trade off maximum volume potential and some bass response for portability. We want to listen to good quality sound at enjoyable volumes without having some big boom box or a/c wires. This unit fits the bill perfectly. I take this with me in my suitcase on business trips and have enjoyed the excellent sound quality all over the world. I am somewhat of an audiophile and have a lot of high-end stereo equipment in my home so I am somewhat picky when it comes to sound. When used within its limitations (size of room and reasonable volume levels) this unit has a very pleasing balanced sound. When pushed in volume the unit gets a bit strident sounding but please be realistic there is only so much someone can ask from a battery powered ""full range"" single speaker. I can tell you I have used this in a conference room during a multimedia presentation and have been amazed at the loudness and sound quality it can produce when asked. It also is great for bopping around my hotel room! Nits to pick? well, the on/off button can get pressed in accidently and drain the batteries, you need to be careful with how you place it in its included case to avoid this. It does have an LED to remind you it is on when not in the case though. Also the battery life is somewhat reduced compared to the previous version, I would say I can get about 6-8 hours constant playing time from a set of batteries playing loudly, to be fair it wil last for many more hours if used sporadically and at a lower than max volume. I highly reccomend this unit for people who dont want to lug around large boom boxes but need good sound in small to mid sized spaces for pleasant music listening (or as a booster speaker for thier PC), not a party speaker but a great music enjoyment speaker. try it you'll like it."
,,Daver89,Decent product,13 Jun 2011,3.0 ,"I bought this little speaker for my iPhone 4 while I process shipment in the stock room at work. It has a good sound top (highest volume level), but can not be played without distortion at the full level. I play two notches below iPhones full volume level, and it fills the entire 40 feet by 15 feet stock room (estimate). So the potential it has is decent despite its lack of capability of playing full blast. However, as soon as I opened the product and tested it out, a horrible screeching noise came out. I thought it was a defect, but after manipulating my iPhone case and its rubbing with the adapter plug in the headphone hole, it stopped. With that said, it is a very sensitive piece of equipment in regards to the plug and headphone jack. As for battery life, I can't really tell you in-depth, but its not all that great. It uses 3 AAA batteries. It went through a pack I had, but those were half-dead I believe. However, I've played it maybe 20-30 hours and the sound quality is already depleting a little (that's usually what happens with these battery powered speakers, bass goes out and it starts sounding worse at high volumes). Again, these batteries, two of them were brand new, another I believe I had not used (but not absolutely certain on that). The best thing I can tell you about this product, is the included case. It makes taking this to work a breeze, as I already have my hands full with a water bottle, a snack, or whatever it is I have in hand. Just put the key-ring insert into your finger and your good to go. The case also provides good protection for the speaker. Think about it, It's portable, you're gonna be transporting it around."
,,Alimd11,This Speaker's A Charm!,03 Aug 2011,5.0 ,"I purchased this little speaker to mount to the handlebars of my bike as I rode across Iowa on RAGBRAI. It was my third and last futile attempt to find a speaker that I could: mount to my handlebars in a GPS mount, actually hear and BONUS! allow my riding partners in the pace line to hear while pedaling. Also required: it wouldn't blow up or distort if played at max volume, could wire seamlessly to an iPod shuffle or the like, wouldn't weigh an exorbitant amount, could withstand heat indexes of 115 degrees for 10+ hours at a time and then sit outside all night and get covered in dew while I slept in my tent...and finally, would not require excessive charging or new batteries throughout the course of a day. So yeah, I had a few expectations and requirements...none of which were particularly realistic. This speaker blew all expectations (and prior purchases for that matter)out of the water. (Both of the other speakers I purchased were ""bike specific"" and blew up after about two hours of 110 degree heat index riding, for the record.) If I had a buck for every person that rolled by on the road to ask me what kind of speaker this was and whether I was happy with it I could buy them for everyone on my team. Best thing is, we all didn't need them...we only needed this one and after a week of that kind of beating, going over nearly 500 miles of bumps cracks and one particularly violent crash (and me dropping it on the concrete pavement three times) the little sucker is still humming along. Also, I used exactly 9 batteries in the thing in 9 days of virtually all day play and never once did I replace them because the others had died...I merely did so because I didn't want to be 70 miles out without tunes. Needless to say, its battery life beat the Shuffle and iTouch I connected to it many, many times over. Buy one. You won't regret it."
,,Todd C Blake,Great Little Speakers!,05 Nov 2011,5.0 ,"These are some amazing sounding little speakers for their size. Don't expect concert hall sound, but they work well for close listening or even outdoors. I purchased a pair of speakers, and use them on my Sony Walkman MP3 player and my Samsung Infuse 4G, with a stereo Y adapter. They sound great on both devices. The second speaker really enhances and amplifies the sound, and you can get the real stereo imaging that the music was recorded in. Who wants to listen to music in mono anyway, unless you have some old transistor raido from the 70's? I use Sanyo Eneloop rechargable batteries in these speakers, and they last a lot longer than regular disposable batteries, and you can just recharge them when they run down. You can actually hear and feel the bass in these speakers, which is amazing in itself for their size. The highs are also very clear, and the speakers do not distort unless you try and force them to do so by turning your listening device all they way up to the maximum volume setting. Altec Lansing makes some great products, and this is just another one of those products. I can highly recommend these speakers, especially at this price. Buy 2 of them like I did!"
,,Jersey Mike,Monitor Quality at a Mini Price,20 Sep 2011,5.0 ,"As with some other gadgets, I've owned a dozen small portable speakers. This one is the best. At under twenty bucks, it's also the best buy. It doesn't charge your device. It doesn't have a case. It requires batteries. It doesn't connect to your USB port. It does not have a volume control. It does not take up much footprint on your desk or night stand. What it DOES do is deliver very precise unforced bass, very accurate well-dispersed highs, and virtually no distortion or coloration. All this from a package the size of a large tuna can. And, with a nice battery level LED to warn of low batteries and a discrete power switch (which is only needed for long term storage, since power draw with no audio input is minimal). It yields optimal sound when sitting on a desk in front of you. In that position, the bass is reinforced by the flat desk surface, and the highs are well projected toward your ears. Works great with my iPhone and to replace the wimpy speaker on my net book. If you want extra features, Altec Lansing makes more deluxe versions of this great speaker for a few dollars more."
,,Tech Mom,Outstanding speaker - Amazing sound for this price!,12 Dec 2011,5.0 ,"This is an outstanding little speaker. I bought them for my entire family this year and one for myself as well! I opened mine, plugged it in and what amazing sound! It is also a very sturdy little speaker since I accidentally dropped it within minutes of using it and it took a good hard drop on the wood floors and was just fine. I have been using it for a week now and it is outstanding AND I have not yet replaced the batteries once which is a nice surprise. I put in 3 AAA Duracell batteries and have been playing it all week - most of the morning and afternoon and still going strong. It does not come with a case however you can order them for less than $5 from the manufacturer. The cord is a bit short also - preventing picking up the ipod without the speaker as well, so I solved that problem for less then $2 by ordering a female/female 3.5mm connector and a retractable 3.5mm stereo extension that is also tiny. Now I have a perfect solution for an astoundingly low cost. I would recommend this little powerhouse speaker to anyone! You can toss it in a backpack or a briefcase to use in hotels, during lunch at school, or at home. It also is perfect for sound on laptops, a Kindle Fire, an iPad etc since it has a standard plug. I needed to show a group of kids a video on my laptop yesterday and brought this along - the speaker was in a huge empty playroom and we had to turn it down since it was too LOUD ... lol .. I saw this originally on the Black Friday lightening deals, missed that sale and still dont care since it is far less expensive than most of the other small portable speakers and has great sound. I read almost every review for this speaker and the Amazon reviewers are quite right - it is terrific."
,,M. Grue,Nowhere near as good as my last Altec,15 Jun 2012,2.0 ,"I used to have this Altec speaker: Altec Lansing iM-237 Orbit Ultraportable Speaker for MP3 Players (Silver) It worked fabulously. It traveled all around China with me and never had a single problem. Unfortunately, once I was back stateside, the floor above me had a plumbing emergency that ended up sending huge amounts of water onto my desk. I got this Altec (the iM227) as a replacement. (Incidentally, after my old speaker dried out, it seems to still work. I might switch back to it.) This speaker is terrible. There is a problem with the battery space. Energizer AAA are somehow too small for one of the slots. I use rechargeable batteries, and I had Energizer batteries. When I use them, the connection is constantly lost and I have to hit the bottom of the speaker to get it to work. I eventually went out and got Rayovac rechargeable batteries, which seem to fit a bit better. I at least have less problems when I use them. (Please note, my Energizer batteries have not malfunctioned in anything else I've used them for.) Overall, this speaker just doesn't work as well as the one I bought a year ago. I think the quality is declining. I don't think this speaker would survive a 6 month trip to China."
,,Michael K. Eidson,Great little speaker for the money,12 Nov 2010,5.0 ,"The radio in my van doesn't work right, and the van is so old, I didn't want to spend a lot of money fixing the radio. So I went online and looked for an alternative to playing music on the radio. I bought a battery operated MP3 player and this Altec Lansing portable speaker, and I play my music that way instead of on the radio. It took a while to get used to the speaker. I didn't read anywhere that the speaker had a little light that glowed red when the batteries were running low, but learned it through experience. My daily commute is 45 minutes to an hour each way, and usually if the little light is green when I start my trip to work, the batteries will last until I get there, even if the light turns red on the way. I can typically go three or four days (about six to eight hours) between changing the batteries. I use rechargeable batteries and keep one set of three batteries charged up so I can swap them out with the three in the speaker when they run out and need recharging. It's not practical or safe to try to switch the batteries while I'm driving, so I do pay attention when that red light comes on, and make sure to change the batteries in the speaker before driving again. A word of advice to help extend battery life: Don't leave the speaker with batteries inside it in your car on a hot day, or your batteries will lose their charge more quickly than they would otherwise. I always put my speaker in my briefcase and take it into my office (or into the house when returning home from work) where the temperatures are moderate. The sound quality of this little speaker is of course not that of your average set of car radio speakers. I have to keep up the windows or the road noise will drown out the sound of this little speaker. But I can deal with that. When the windows are up, the speaker is more than loud enough for me to enjoy my music while I drive. I don't know how I could have purchased anything else that would have given me better sound quality for the price. What I'm most concerned about with this speaker is how much longer the parts will last. I don't turn the volume on the MP3 player all the way up, so as not to blow the speaker. I'm also very careful with the jack plug cord, which looks like it could easily pop loose if pulled on too hard; so far, it's holding strong, and it's now been about five months since I started using this speaker. With a little care, I hope this speaker will last for as long as I keep my old van."
,,Jim,Better than you think,23 Feb 2011,5.0 ,"I've been eyeing this little speaker up for quite a while. I finally bit the bullet and ordered, and I haven't stopped listening to it yet. For such a small speaker, the sound is incredibly clear and crisp, even at higher volumes and with a decent amount of bass. It has surpassed all of my expectations. I brought it to work, and everyone within earshot came over and commented quite favorably about the sound. I've gotten maybe 10 hours out of the batteries(which were included) so far, and they don't appear to be showing any signs of wearing out yet. It comes with it's own carry case for protection as well. Overall, I'd HIGHLY recommend this product. ***Attention Audiophiles** It's not perfect, and it's not made by Bose, so if you need flawless perfection in your audio, don't bother with this. **UPDATE** 2 months later, and still going strong! After HEAVY usage on a daily basis, I haven't had a single problem with this speaker. Average battery life is about 25 hours, which is typically unheard of in items like this, but it's true. This little speaker keeps on cranking out the tunes, and has shown no signs of slowing down."
,,Croce,Everyone Loves This Little Guy,19 Jan 2014,5.0 ,"Packs a big sonic punch for it's little size. Two of my sisters bought their own after hearing mine. It filled our garage with music during our yard sale. Three AAA batteries last a long time. The battery light turns from green to red when you are running low on juice, but you can still get a few more hours listening until the sound quality deteriorates - then change the batteries. I recommend marking the bottom with a line from a Sharpie prior to removing the cord/battery cover. Then you can easily replace it, by lining up your mark when it is properly closed with a twist. Well worth the money. Edited on 02/13/15 - This little guy just went stone cold dead on me. New batteries won't bring it back. It lasted for a good year or so and then said goodbye. I won't change the star rating because before it passed away it was a good little guy."
,,Sheena R. C.,"I wanted to write a positive review, but...",16 Jun 2011,1.0 ,"Unfortunately, the product lasted less than 24 hours. I was all set to write a great review. When I took the product from it's packaging, I was impressed with the look of the speaker: simple design and not cheap looking. I like the case & the fact that there is a speaker strap as well as a case clip. The sound is good, well it was good. It's very easy to use: batteries install easily and no complicated features, just one power button. Also, the price is reasonable. I followed the directions regarding turning off the phone's equalizer and turning the volume to 75-80%. The speaker worked great last night, and for a little while this morning. Unfortunately, the speaker suddenly stopped working. The power light is on, and the batteries aren't run down. The phone settings are correct. For whatever reason, it just quit. I wasn't even moving it around: I had it sitting on a counter playing music from my iPod, and the music stopped coming out of the speaker. I've done all the trouble shooting I can do to no avail. I'm bummed, because I don't see any speakers in the same price range that appeal to me. While the reviews of this product are overwhelmingly positive, you need to be aware that there are quite a few reviews that state the same thing as mine: this product dies for no reason."
,,Larry Ross,"Good, but easily made great.",19 Feb 2010,5.0 ,"This is not a bad little speaker. It does however have a problem... it is a single speaker and thus it only produces sound in mono. This is EASILY fixed. I bought two of these speakers. I then bought a cheap adapter cord to allow me to pair up the speakers for true stereo sound. The trick is to get the correct adapter cord with a standard male mini jack on one end, and then splitting into female left and right mono on the other end. Try doing a search for something like ""3.5mm Stereo M to Dual 3.5mm Mono F Splitter."" This allows me to use both speakers together for true left and right separated stereo sound. For the money, I have not come across anything that sounds as good. Another benefit of using the adapter is that it extends the length of the speaker cords, allowing me to separate the speakers from each other. I keep the adapter cable stored in one of the speaker cases, and then I clip the two cases together with the included carabiners. When circumstances require me to travel light, I can of course just pack one single speaker. I believe this gives me the ultimate in flexibility."
,,Christopher Paquette,This thing is awesome!,11 Jan 2012,5.0 ,"I wanted a small set of speakers for my new Samsung Chromebook. Something I could easily take along with me to improve upon the awful built-in speakers on the Chromebook. After doing a quick search I saw this and was intrigued by its simple design and the fact that it is only one speaker, instead of having two speakers dangling from your laptop. I was a little nervous about the sound being in mono vs. stereo, but all that was put aside the moment I plugged this into my Chromebook. The sound is rich and room filling. Might not satisfy the most demanding audiophiles, but then it is not advertised as something to rival a Bose system. This is exactly what I was looking for! A small portable speaker system that sounds awesome! I love it! *** Follow up. After almost six months of using this product I still love it. I am using rechargeable batteries in this and they seem to last forever. I have read that this unit is supposed to run approximately 24 hours on a set of batteries. My experience is that it will run way longer than that. I have only had to re-charge my set of batteries 3 times in six months. I don't use this speaker on a daily basis, but I am more than satisfied with the lack of battery drain."
,,FixitupMan,Fair but could use improvement,30 Dec 2010,3.0 ,"Quick review for those on the go. I have a rechargeable Li-ion MP3 speaker as well. This unit has better mid and low end range, but the overall volume is not as good. I bought 3 of these as gifts and tried one out before giving it away. Right out of the box, I noticed a major design flaw. The bottom of the speaker has a molded in plug holder that the integrated plug fits into nicely. When I plugged one it, the headphone jack already had deteriorated and crackled with that classic, 'going going, almost gone' headphone crackle. The combination of having to wrap the six inch cord around the base, and popping the plug into the base means that within a few months the cord will be shot. Since the cord is attached, and there is no headphone jack, you cant replace the cord unless you feel like brushing up on your soldering. I'd much rather have a jack and a short jumper connector. Then if it does go bad a two dollar cable fixes my twenty to thirty dollar speaker. Instead it will be a paper weight. Hopefully the two I gave as gifts at least make it out of the box with dieing. I expected more from a trusted brand in speakers."
,,MWebb,Much better sound quality than the iHome iHM60,26 May 2011,5.0 ,"Very slick build quality and snug travel case. Doesn't require charging since it runs on AAA batteries. Greatly improves laptop sound if you are watching a movie or tv on the road (but it's mono, not stereo). Adequate for music when used with an iPod etc. - you get enough ""musicality"" to be able to judge whether you would like to play that song on a ""real"" stereo, or drag out your earphones. Also good for sharing a song with a friend so they can judge for themselves whether to add to their own player. Adequate for background music while puttering around, but not for serious listening. Much better sound quality than the iHome iHM60 iHome iHM60 Rechargeable Mini Speakers for iPod (Gun Metal Gray) . But on the other hand the iHome is MUCH smaller, and still delivers adequate quality for watching the news on a laptop - but music is not so hot, compared to the Altec Lansing. And yes, either speaker is terrific in comparison with the terrible speakers in the netbooks I have."
,,Trekker,Nice sound for super convenient package,26 Aug 2009,4.0 ,"Let me start off by saying that if you are looking for a boombox sound from a tiny single speaker, you probably will be disappointed. With that being said, I was looking for a good balance of sound and ultra portability. For my needs, I think I found it with the iM-237. Its not amplified in any way, so obviously the more powerful your mp3 player, the louder this speaker will play. I am using a mid-level MP3 Sony Walkman and I crank it up to about 2/3rds to max volume and get a nice full sound. My wife has a better MP3 Walkman and is more powerful, so she gets the same full sound at about 1/2 volume (the iM-237 sounds louder with her mp3 player). I tried various types of music on it with my Walkman and overall my mp3 player limits the loudness of this tiny speaker. Although it doesn't crank up to loud volumes, I was surprised by the sound quality of this tiny single speaker. It was well balanced (even has a hint of bass) and at max volume never reached noisy distortion levels. Our intent was to use this product in places without loud ambient noises; for personal listening at a calm beach, a picnic at the lake, camping in the woods, and things like that. For this purpose, the sound and ultra portability of this device is just what we were looking for."
,,Fred,Altec Lansing iM-237 Orbit,22 Sep 2011,5.0 ,"I was in the market for a nice portable speaker for listening to my music at lunch time. I have a few Altec Lansing products, so I ordered this little guy. Well I will say I was a bit concerned by the thin-ness of the plug. I have a few heavy handed friends who will not be borrowing this. That aside, we put in the batteries, pressed the power button and started the music. I was greeted with a very full sound from a pretty unassuming device. No, it`s not like that sub in that Honda Civic that was beside you at the traffic light, on the way home from work the other day. The sound was much better than any phone speaker. Quite a bit more round , with a clean, not harsh, high end. Very clear mid-range, and plenty of volume. The carry case was nicely done. A belt clip comes with the case. The battery life seems pretty good to me. I work 5 days a week, and I`ve had the same battery set in for about 1.5 months. For personal listening, or, something to take out while drinking a cup of coffee in the morning, or listening to an audio book or music at a lunch break, this is a very worthwhile speaker."
,,JPN,Great Little Speaker,28 Sep 2012,5.0 ,"Bought this at the beginning of the summer for an easy way to listen to music from my phone. I've heard some other speakers in the past and was actually going to buy a different one until I read the reviews on this one, so I gave it a shot. This speaker, for it's size and price, delivers very good sound. I usually have it on a table outside, on the front porch, out back by the camp fire, or by the hammock and it provides enough clear sound to entertain. It's not going to DJ your next party for you, but it's going to keep you and a small group of friends listening to tunes for relatively short change for a long time. I used it several times a week, for hours at a time, all summer, plus left it ""on"" a couple of nights all night long and I'm on my second set of batteries, they seem to last a long time. Only flaw I found was that it tipped over once and started cutting in and out, the battery contacts are a little flimsy and one got bent back and wasn't making contact, a toothpick to pry it and it was fixed in a minute, been fine ever since."
,,BigShoppingRiverCruiser,"Best ""in class""",19 Apr 2011,4.0 ,"I think there isn't a better speaker in this form factor/size. Its easily to haul around, occupies little or no space on the desk or in the luggage, and runs on 3 AAA batteries. Are there better speakers ? Sure, many, and much better and with more bass but a lot larger too! And make that two, not one. And they cost more. And they come with a few cables that tangle things up a bit as well. Now about the sound - It can get loud! But its not meant to be driven loud - it will distort. At low/normal levels the sound is free of any obvious distortions. Its clean and clear. It doesn't sound like a small tinny speaker. The sound has some weight to it. Perhaps a longer cable would have allowed it to be a bit more useful - like as a desktop speaker, or other devices with not so good onboard speakers. But I guess you can always buy an extension cable for $5 at Radioshack."
,,Teejeronimo,Died after about 1 week of nightly use,18 Jan 2014,1.0 ,"I purchased this unit a few years ago. I bought it really to take with me to the park. Never really had very many opportunities to use it... I usually forgot to pack it. Recently, my older son wanted to listen to music in his room. How convenient... I took this out and he plugged in his iPod. After only about 1 week of using it nightly, the speaker busted. My son didn't listen to it loud. He had basically ambiance music playing quietly while he read or did his homework. The sound quality is good for its size, but the durability is not there. I was planning on buying another for my younger son and glad I didn't make that second purchase before this speaker burned. Literally we smelled electric burn."
,,Harry M. Shin,Another excellent product via Altec,14 Aug 2010,5.0 ,"1. This is a top notch product for it's price and intended purpose. Here are a couple of my summary thoughts: * Price: it's definitely a good value for the quality / sound / size etc... * Quality of construction: lightweight (which is good for travel), yet feels solid and the construction seems to be sound. * Ease of use: extremely a no brainer--> one button to turn off /on, the volume is controlled via the ipod. The cable is built into the speaker--> plug it into the ipod headphone hole. * Sound quality: amazingly excellent. Supposedly this is not stereo (obviously because there's is only one speaker), but the sound is... well, it sounds like stereo. Don't expect this to be the sound system for your party, but when you need a very compact, yet quality speaker system for your ipod, you can't purchase a better product that this one. 2. Highly recommended for it's intended purpose (ie lightweight, very compact speaker for the ipod with excellent sound). Well done Altec Lansing."
,,BillyRo,Case of the missing case,18 Sep 2011,4.0 ,"After reading several positive reviews of the iM-237 and iM-227, I ordered the iM-237. Problem is I was sent the iM-227. From what I had read, the iM-227 speaker is the exact same speaker as the iM-237 speaker, but the iM-227 does not come with the handy protective travel case, which was the reason I paid a little more for the iM-237. It's a good little speaker for small areas, good solid sound but a little light on bass, which I expected given the size. But it does sound solid with good range, not tinny sounding with all treble and no mid-range or bass. As noted in some reviews, the cord is pretty short, but it's manageable. No volume contol on the speaker, you just use the volume control on your device. Battery life (3 AAA, not included) is supposed to be 24 hrs, but I haven't used it long enough to know. Ditto on how it will hold up over time. I emailed the seller (Amazon-OEM) about sending the wrong order. At first they tried to tell me that the speakers were identical. I told them true, but I wanted the case (which I paid for). They ended up offering to refund 1/2 of the purchase price to keep the iM-227, so I ended up with the speaker, sans case, for just under $15. In hindsight, I'm glad about the mix-up. For under $15, I got a real good sounding little speaker that I use with my mp3 player when I don't use earbuds. I doubt there are any other speakers at that price that match the sound of the iM-227/iM-237. If you don't want a travel case, the iM-227 is the same speaker as the iM-237 and costs less."
,,Vengeance,Very Nice Speaker!,06 Feb 2017,5.0 ,I purchased this speaker for my spirit box and also to use on my phone. I am very pleased with the quality of sound and looks of this speaker. It's well worth the money I paid for it. It's loud and has good bass like larger speakers have. I recommend this item to everyone who loves good quality in sound of a speaker system. The item arrived quickly and was packed very well. Thanks so much! :)
,,G2 in Painted Post NY,Grab one when you can,29 Mar 2010,5.0 ,"I've been on a search for a portable speaker for my travels Had a small Bytech, too small, got the X-Mini now that's a good one and one I'll also bring along since it has a rechargeable battery inside. Had the iHome and X-Mini II Max, both were 'ok' but not as musical as I'd like. I held off getting this one, mainly due to the need of carrying 3 batteries but finally kicked in and picked one up, arrived tonight, ordered two more one for each of my daughters, it is QUITE good and I'll not sweat having to cough up 3 batteries at all. Volumne is loud, as loud as I need it, fills a room pretty easily Bass, well it is a small speaker but it does have some bass, so the voices and instruments come across fairly accurately, to me at least. So for my travels, the X-Mini for it's rechargeable battery and also pretty good sound, not as FULL as the Altec but easy to listen too and this Altec for it's superior overall sound. Impressed and a happy buy with this, G2"
,,Ludix,Great sound for the money,01 Mar 2011,5.0 ,"This little guy is just what I needed for travel. It lets me enjoy my portable mp3 player on the road, and it runs on three easily-obtained AAA batteries so I don't need a USB connection or charger. Works fine with my laptop as well, and sounds MUCH better than the built-in speakers. The sound is very clean and reasonably well balanced, with more than enough volume for a hotel room. There is no deep bass, of course, but I didn't expect any from a device this small and cheap. Two criticisms: 1. The cover of the battery compartment is finicky. It usually takes three or four attempts to fit it back on. 2. The audio cord that connects to your mp3 player or computer is only about nine inches long. This isn't an issue with mp3 players, but it feels crowded with my laptop. An extender solves this problem. I'm more than satisfied, and recommend this unit."
,,Yager,Good sounds and great size...definitely worth the money,04 Jan 2013,5.0 ,"I have had some Altec Lansing speakers for my computer in the past and they were pretty awesome. I read a bunch of the reviews and actually watched some youtube videos prior to purchasing this speaker. I liked the fact that it had replaceable batteries versus the rechargeable ones that you have to throw away once they don't hold a charge any longer. The size of this thing is basically like two hockey pucks stacked. It is extremely loud for its size. I use it out in the yard while doing yardwork, in the kitchen while cooking and listening to Pandora. I have yet to replace the batteries and have owned it for 4 months. I would definitely recommend it for someone looking to listen to some tunes while not having to lug around bulky stuff. I plug it into my phone and I am done. It travels well also."
,,jdickey,Good inexpensive and very portable speaker,11 Aug 2013,4.0 ,"We were first exposed to this when we stayed for a few days with a friend had one and used it extensively. We enjoyed the sound so much (and heard such good feedback from her) that my wife asked for one the minute we got back home. She's had it for over a year now and has no complaints at all. It's a huge improvement from the sound out of the iPhone 4s she has and the iPhone 5 I have. Yes, it's only one speaker so it doesn't have huge stereo separation. And it's small, so while the bass is a big step up from the phone, it's not equivalent to what you'd get from a sub-woofer. But the battery lasts a long time, it's small and lightweight (though feels and is a durable, good quality build), and the sound is more than satisfactory."
,,DoodL~Love,Amazing sound quality!,29 Jul 2009,5.0 ,"I remember going to a concert and about 1/2 way through this tiny kid got up to sing a solo. She looked like she could be knocked over with a feather, but when she began to sing peoples jaws dropped, and you could hear peoples amazement! Her voice was so beautiful - it carried all the way to the back of the concert hall, and made my hair stand on end and tears well up in my eyes. Well, I'm not going to get all teary and sappy over this speaker, but it really does deliver! I bought it for my husband for Christmas. He's pretty fussy about his music and components. He doesn't have to have anything fancy, but he loves good sound quality. After he'd had the speaker for awhile he confessed to me that when he opened the package he didn't expect much; he said he was ""blown away"" by how incredible the sound quality was and how loud it could get for such a small speaker. Now we've all had an opportunity to listen to music from the speaker, and we all agree - it's such a nice speaker I'm going to buy another to give to our oldest daughter before she leaves for college."
,,Amazon Customer,excellent for the price and intended use,21 Aug 2009,4.0 ,"I am using this to listen to Pandora on my Blackberry 8830 while tanning outside in a lounge chair. It sounds way better than the speaker on the BB, which is all I was really after. It's small enough for travel and connects to my laptop, so double bonus. My travel JBL On Tour speakers sound only slightly better, but that's a bigger/heavier unit and if you're like me, size and weight matter when traveling. I took away one star due to the shortness of the cord and the lack of real deep bass. WARNING: take the batteries out before you store the unit in the case. It fits so snug, that it turns the power on, drains the battery, then lets out a high pitched screech, that eventually kills the speaker if left unattended overnight. I am on my second unit. I made this mistake the first night with the original unit shipped to me. Luckily I got a replacement at no cost to me."
,,D,"Great bang for your buck. Full sound, not tinny.",03 Oct 2013,5.0 ,"The sound is pretty amazing for the size and the money. No, it's not a bose or bang & olufsen, or the like, so don't expect that kind of sound. But it will boost the volume on your smart phone or ipod without sounding tinny. It has a pretty full sound and it uses regular AA batteries, or rechargeable ones, and it's simple. Just plug into the headphone jack, turn it on and control volume with whatever you are plugging it into. I take it with me whenever I travel. Great to use in hotel rooms for music, or movie on your ipad as examples. Have given as gifts many times and always a huge hit. Some of the other models like this, by altec lansing, altho' slicker with more bells and whistles not quite as good( unless you spend a great deal more)."
,,Mike V,dead mans switch,15 Apr 2015,1.0 ,"I wanted this thing to take camping, and I'm sure it would have worked great for that purpose if I had received a functioning unit. The one I received, however, works for however long I feel like holding the power button down, which is not very long. As soon as I stop pushing the button, it powers off like a dead mans switch. I can't even give it 2 stars. The sound isn't bad, and would have worked well for camping - not super loud, but much better than my Galaxy S5. Having to hold the button down makes this just junk for me, a purchase I regret, and therefore 1 star. You might get lucky though!"
,,Hedley Lamarr,Good product,25 Nov 2011,5.0 ,I've had this speaker for a couple weeks and I'm happy with it. It has great sound compared to my exceptionally-quiet Dell laptop. Good bass too. I have 2 suggestions for future versions of this speaker. 1) Either make the speaker cord longer or make it a modular connector (male 1/8 mini plug to male 1/8 mini plug). That way we can choose our own cord length to meet our individual needs. 2) Make the unit take AA batteries for better battery length. It won't require much more additional space than the AAA batteries currently. 3) Allow the unit to be powered from an external power source such as USB (dual-USB ports if necessary) or an AC adapter. This would make the speaker useful for long road trips or long durations. I would recommend this product to others.
,,Imelda,Much improved over 1st version.,06 Dec 2009,5.0 ,"I had the original version of this speaker (until I left it in a rental car and it was ""never found"" by the agency). That speaker sounded great but I had a horrible time turning it on and off, because there wasn't a power button. Rather, the top had to be twisted and it took a special touch, which clearly I didn't have. This version sounds great still, although I listen mainly to audiobooks, so I can't speak as to music quality. The speaker still has no volume control, so you still need to control that through your music player. However, the power button is great, and includes a power light you can see if you forgot to turn it off after unplugging your player. I believe the size is a tad smaller in diameter, and a tad thicker in depth, so overall it's still very portable. The addition of a case is nice, makes it a little more secure to travel with, especially banging around in my carry-on or backpack. Also, especially when on sale, the price can't be beaten."
,,M2,Better than expected...,17 Mar 2010,4.0 ,"I travel frequently. I usually carry two laptops, my 80G IPOD, and all kinds of cords and accessories. The dilemma? Travel speaker that is much better than the on-board laptop speakers, but small enough to reasonably fit into my bag with all the other stuff. I also looked at the USB powered model of this speaker, but chose this one because of the price and reviews. I have rechargeable AAA batteries. The sound - surprisingly full with enough low end to raise an eyebrow. I guess it's the ""can"" design that makes that work. It's a full range speaker and it sounds smooth listening to classical or rock. My case is not tight like some have reported. I guess the power switch could turn on in the case given the design. I didn't attach the lanyard since I can't imagine why I would carry it that way. It has four rubber feet that grip a table nicely so it doesn't slide around. I wish it had was a volume control built in but I solved that with a small inline volume control from Radio Shack. A DC adapter input would have been nice too. It's a perfect laptop speaker/IPOD upgrade and easily fills a hotel room with a pleasing sound."
,,Bill L.,Cool little speaker,14 Mar 2012,4.0 ,"Wanted to use my ipod in my 69 VW Squareback with out mounting a CD/radio and noticed these speakers on Amazon. I purchased 2 and using industrial Velcro, mounted them on the kick panel carpeting (facing the driver and passenger) and ran extension cables to a HOSA Stereo 3.5mm cable (whitch connects to the ipod. Then layed the ipod in the dash ash tray....... works and sounds pretty cool. Speakers really push the sound out and very happy with the sound they produce. Only thing was one of the speaker switchs was not catching when pushed on. I took the top cover off and tweeked the switch a little.... seemed to work, as it now catch's in the on position..... hopefully this will work ok and last...... switch is kind of small so we'll see. Didn't want to return it just yet as it has a 1 year warrany. Otherwise, works great for what I needed it for."
,,AmazonWoman,Bought maybe 4? Each one broke,27 Oct 2013,1.0 ,"I run an entertainment company and we need iPod docks to play/conduct Dance Games for kids birthday parties. The reviews for the Altec were so mixed, but it was so cheap I thought I'd give it a try. Initially I was SO impressed. The sound was so clear and SO loud (not easy to find with an iPod dock) After buying one and hearing the loudness and clarity, I rushed to order a few more. But.. one by one, each speaker came back not working. After a short time, the speaker would emit this OBNOXIOUS, loud, screeching sound akin to a horror movie. Perhaps it just needed new batteries? No... new batteries did not fix the issue. If the screeching sound was appeased by some fresh batteries, the sound was never the same... super tingy and kinda like nails on a chalk board. You found yourself rushing to turn it off. Now, I can overlook a bad review where one person has a faulty product, especially since so many reviewers said positive things. But, come on!... I bought 4! (gosh maybe even 5... I lost count) and they ALL had the same issue. Keep in mind, my staff was using these every weekend, 2-4 parties a day for each performer, so you could argue that perhaps we ran the product into the ground. BUT... each speaker lasted about ONE month before we had an issue. One month... Sorry Altec Lansing owner guy... so wish your product lasted because I have yet to find an iPod dock that could compete sound-wise against and old school boombox (I've bought many... trust me) And if you figure out a way to make your product last (um... longer than a month) I will happily buy another an update my terrible review. Until then... we will continue to annoy and disappoint countless clients and their children with our crappy iPod docks that can barely be heard over a group of 10 kids. ;-("
,,Spear,Altec iM227 & AYL mine (real customer review),24 Nov 2011,3.0 ,"I bought the Altec iM227 Orbit after looking over lots of reviews, and because it was cheap I also bought the AYL mini (black) here on Amazon. First off I work in a warehouse and drive on a rider jack all night. Was looking for a little speaker I could plug my mp3 player into that would be loud enough to hear as I'm driving...sounds of the rider jack itself and driving across the concrete floor create noise. I'll try to keep this concise. I would give the Altec a 3.5 stars if I could and the AYL 3 stars. In the end Altec wins out slightly. Altec iM227 The Altec iM227 and the iM 235 are the exact same device....only difference is the iM235 comes with a carrying case to protect it...well iM227 being $16 and the im235 being $40...another $24 for a carrying case? I don't need that, I'm using it not carrying it. Sound....better sound than the AYL mini...it's richer and deeper, like you'd hear from your car speakers, with some bass sound. Loudness...well if I turned my mp3 player up all the way, it will distort on harder hitting songs, that is clear. Some of the song loudness has to do with what format/quality the song is on your MP3 player. I noticed some songs were just louder than others. Battery... Altec takes 3 AAA. I like this feature. Because, if it runs out, you just have a back up to swap in. Now for people whom like rechargables...well you can get rechargable AAA batteries and thus now you have a rechargable unit, have a set of AAA charging, and a set your using, or 3 sets, one charging, one as a back up, and one your using. The battery life is hands down better than the AYL, hands down. I'd say 6-8 hours. Packaging...horrible. Took me forever getting into the packaging, good luck getting it out to try and not damage the package...not gonna happen. A draw back of the Altec is the back plate for the battery, horrible. It's hard to see how to exactly click it in place. Very easy to mess up then your battery's don't stay connected. Also, the cord that connects to your MP3 player, way to short, like 5 inches. AYL mini The AYL is louder than the Altec, but at a sound quality cost. The AYL is just like a tweater and has that twingy sound to it. But it doesn't distort much and I can turn my mp3 player all the way up for the most part. Package was excellent, really professional looking and not bad to get into. Comes with a little cloth carrying case. The cords on the AYL are SO long, almost too long. You have like 2 feet I swear. The one cord has the jack to go into your mp3 players and the connection to charge it. Battery life....HORRIBLE. This is a contained rechargeable unit, horrible life. I'd say 2 hours to 2.5 at most. The claims on the page were upwards of 12 hrs. Now I wasn't expecting that with rock music and being loud....but 2.5 hours? And guess what, since I can't swap out the battery, I have to charge it, which takes like 1.5 to 2 hrs to do so. What else, oh, the AYL is like half the size of the Altec if thats something you want. Overall Altec wins...AYL wins in loudness, cord length and size (if thats important?), Altec wins in sound quality, battery life, and easy of battery swapping (hey I listen to it say 5 hrs a night...battery last about one night, where the AYL would last me half the night). Hope this helps, any questions leave a comment and I will give you my best response/opinion."
,,Gadget Fan in CA,Hidden wrist strap,13 Dec 2011,5.0 ,"A lot of great reviews here so I won't discuss sound quality, etc. I do agree that the cable is a little too short. I just measured the cable and it is 7.5 inches to the beginning of the plug. I also agree the lack of a volume control is a little inconvenient. The speaker is 3.5 inches in diameter (counting the on/off button that sticks out a tiny bit) and 2.0 inches high. The thing I want to mention that I didn't see in other reviews is that the wrist strap in my packaging was oddly hidden. It was folded up into a tiny square, maybe a quarter inch square and wrapped tightly in plastic. That tiny square of material was taped up inside a square of cardboard in the blister pack. Pretty easy to miss. I almost threw it away but got curious as to what the black piece of ""tape"" I saw was. So be sure to hunt for it before throwing out the packaging. If you did miss it, it's not a big deal. It's the same thing as the cheap wrist strap that comes with an inexpensive mobile phone. I bought it to use with my Kindle Fire. No problems so far."
,,Constantinople,"Cute speaker, surprisingly loud and resonant",08 Apr 2014,4.0 ,"Is this going to replace your sound system? No. It's definitely a portable speaker, but it projects well enough to be heard clearly, even outdoors. I use it occasionally by the beach or in the park, and it's plenty loud for a picnic. The sound is also surprisingly full bodied from such a small speaker. The actual product is very nicely made, if a bit plain in design. I would count on this lasting a long time. It does eat up batteries, on the order of tens of hours per set. Comes in its own lightly padded case, and the connector cable tucks in underneath the speaker. The price was a bit high, but this is actually a good quality portable speaker."
,,PBeth,A Great Portable Speaker,26 Nov 2011,4.0 ,"If you're looking for a speaker that will provide high quality, clear and perfect sound, then buy a real stereo system. The purpose of this speaker is its portability, and it just so happens that it puts out great sound for its intended purpose. I was pleasantly surprised to say the least. The only downside is that it cannot handle hardly any bass sound - especially dubstep. This should not come as a surprise, but in the event that anyone out there is looking for a little speaker that can handle big bass, this is not the one for you. In addition, this speaker has no volume control. If the music playing device is turned up all the way, the sound will be distorted. It is recommended in the instructions that the volume only be 3/4's of the way up. This speaker also comes with a round, sturdy zip case that I actually use."
,,C. John Smith,Great Sound when it worked,22 May 2012,3.0 ,"Bought it in october of 2011. Its now dead. This little speaker had really good sound but unfortunately did not last very long. The speaker gets pretty minimal usage, when I first got it, I used it all the time for the first month. But the past fews months it has had very minimal usage. I tried using it today, turned it on and the red light came on. So I tried changing the batteries 3 times (9 batteries) But no luck. Edit: I took it apart and fiddled with the wiring and got it to work. Changing my review from 3 to 4 stars. Edit 2 May '12: Stopped working again. Changing review back to 3 stars, and keeping it that way. Edit 3 July '12: Started working again today. Don't know what is wrong with this speaker but its now working again. Reliability in my case is a 5/10."
,,Silverk,did not perform as expected,26 Nov 2011,3.0 ,"I bought this speaker to listen to music with my ipod while i sleep. The main problems i ran into were: the audio cord is very short, maybe a few inches. The batteries drained quickly, maybe 8hrs(used sanyo eneloop). No power cord option. It uses three batteries which makes it a hassle to charge since most chargers charge in pairs. When the power is running low while playing music, the speakers will start making loud distortion noises, which freaked my wife and I out when we slept. And the last concern, which isnt really a problem, was that the speaker isnt all that small. In the end i returned these and got the AYL mini speaker which are also sold on amazon. The AYL speaker performed superb. They seem better in every way without any of the issues listed above. For about the same price, you get a lithium rechargeable speaker that has power cord option even while playing. Also the sound is noticeably clearer(nature sounds, rain, water etc.), of course this stuff isnt bass heavy, so i did not take this into account. I wont go on about the ayl and save that for their review."
,,Led Jedi,Excellent little speaker,02 May 2011,5.0 ,"The wife and I picked this up for listening to music and audio books on road trips. It's cheaper than getting a new deck for the car since most of our music is in mp3 and the deck in the car doesn't play that. This was a great alternative. We did a 6 hour road trip this weekend using it the whole time and never had to change batteries. Sound quality is exceptional. Not much base, but it's a small speaker. Even then it has more than I would expect. Seems to be pretty solid construction. Takes 3 AAA batteries, which appear to last long. My ONLY complaint is that I wish the cord was a bit longer. It's only 5-6 inches. In the car that's a bit of a PITA to configure so I had to get a mini-rca cable extension. Other than that though this was a great little investment. We'll be using it for years, i'm sure."
,,Figaro,great little can of sound,24 Sep 2012,5.0 ,"I read reviews on a LOT of products before settling on this speaker. I wanted something that was light and portable, easy to use, has decent sound, and plugs in instead of using bluetooth or airplay. I have had this Altec for almost 2 months now. This speaker was exactly what I was looking for--and has much better sound than I expected. I expected a slight improvement upon the iPad speakers, but this Altec is a HUGE HUGE HUGE improvement over using the iPad or iPhone's built-in speakers. I like that this speaker is not heavy on the bass, and the brights are not too bright. The sound carries much MUCH better than the iPad's regular speakers, which was the main reason I wanted this product. When washing dishes or using the shower, the iPad's sound is completely washed out. Now that I have this speaker, I can hear my music loud and clear (without even turning the volume all the way up). I plug my iPad or iPhone into our stereo receiver when we want excellent sound quality in our living room, but I use this can speaker in other rooms of the house: bedroom, bathroom, kitchen. I have also taken it along in the car. This Altec speaker is easy to use. You plug it in, push the power button (a light comes on so you know it is on), and use your DEVICE to control volume and everything else. I like that it doesn't have all kinds of buttons--I have all the controls I need on my iPad or iPhone. The speaker seems very durable and solid, so I am not afraid to travel with it. It comes with a nice zippered case, it fits tightly so it doesn't add much bulk, it includes an optional carabiner and/or wrist-strap. I attached both the carabiner and wrist strap, but have not yet decided which one I prefer since I do not carry it in its case very often. If you do not need the case, there is an option to buy this speaker without it to save a few dollars. I, however, like having the option of the carry case and do not regret my decision to have it included. I like that it uses batteries--I use NiMH rechargeables and have not had to recharge them yet after light use. You can charge your apple device while using the Altec speaker, BUT there is a slight buzz/humming sound through the speaker if you use it while charging your device. This annoys me, but it is fairly quiet and my husband does not notice it at all. To get around this, I simply don't charge my device when using the Altec, which does not bother me. I use this speaker with my iPhone 4 and iPad 2 with no problem, but it can be used with other devices as well. It comes with an adapter, but I am not sure what sort of device the adapter is for."
,,Danny N,Pretty good sound for a portable speaker!!,30 Jun 2010,4.0 ,"This is a nice, somewhat little speaker for the price. It sounds much better than any phone speakers and definitely makes the ipod touch internal speakers sound like a whisper of sorts. If you turn the volume high enough, you can hear in a few rooms away, so yeah, its gets pretty loud. However, i only gave it 4 stars because of the fact that beyond 90% volume, it gets a little distorted and at MAX volume the distortion is clearly audible which makes it sound horrible. So the best way to listen to your music is to leave it at about 85-90% and it will sound good. In fact, thats what the manufacturer recommends, theres a paper in the box that tells u to leave it at 85-90% and disable any EQ for best quality. I, however found that if i enable treble booster on my ipod it sounds much better and much clearer. Another thing i found that is somewhat an annoyance to me is the short plug that it comes with. It wraps nicely on the bottom of the speaker and i don't find it that big of a problem to be considered a deal breaker. Just that, if they designed it so that the plug is not integrated and it could be removed, then we could easily replace the plug with our own longer cords. Although i suspect if you needed a longer cord for whatever reasons you could always buy an extension cable. The plug is about 8 or so inches fully extended so it's not so bad. So because its such a minor problem for me i didn't mark it down a star. The power button is simple, you depress the button to turn it on and vice versa. You have to depress it a little farther than usual so it'll be difficult for it to automatically turn on while traveling with. When its on, there is an LED next to the power button which turns green, when it is running low on battery the quality of the music gets distorted and the LED will turn to an amber LED. The battery is inserted at the base of the speaker. All you have to do is twist the cap at the base slightly to the left and it pops right off,no hassle. It comes with a belt clip which attaches to the zipper case, and also comes with a lanyard for the speaker. Overall its solidly built, but the zipper case that comes with it could be better. It fits in the case very snugly, a little too snugly if you asked me, but it still better than nothing. Anyways, i think i covered just about everything there is to know, hope this helps future buyers!"
,,GMann,"Small speaker, BIG sound. (vs. X-mini)",21 Oct 2011,5.0 ,"I bought two speakers, this Altec Lansing iM227 and the (red) X-Mini New Generation v1.1 Capsule Speaker - There's no comparison, the Altec is bigger and makes a deeper, clearer sound. The X-Mini is very clear, and the pop up lid really brings out the treble. But since speakers move air, a larger one usually wins, especially with the bass notes. When I plugged the Altec into the X-Mini , the sound was unbelievable (good). If you want to buy just one, go with the Altec - it's portable, and has a rich tone (put it in a empty) jacuzzi or sink and the sound is even better). Even at higher volumes, the music and voices are clear. If you need a smaller one for, ie, a cubicle, the X-Mini is a good choice. If you're inclined to string several together for an even greater sound, go with the X-Mini's, since you can piggyback as many of them as you want. Hope this helps."
,,K. Geurts,Altec iM-237 vs X-Mini 2 Capsule speaker,16 Feb 2011,5.0 ,"After a long and lengthy research process here on Amazon, Youtube, and many other ""review"" sites, I narrowed it down to these two speakers. Unable to make up my mind, and didn't want to get buyers remorse, I decided to buy both. The short version of this review is the Altec iM-237 is the winner here in my opinion. The reasons for this are in the ""long version"" to follow. I recently recieved a Zune HD player (love it!). I am an active outdoorsman who spends alot of time hunting and fishing in remote areas, but love my music when I get back to camp. Hense, the need for a small, portable speaker. If I,(you) were to buy the X-mini only, we would both be very happy and impressed with it. For such a small unit it really puts out nice sound. The built in rechargable battery is a nice option, but for me, in some of the areas I camp, I do not always have access to a 12volt charging source. It seems well built and the option of connecting these speakers with more speakers is another nice option I think. Like I said earlier, if I just bought this speaker, I would be happy, but when compared side by side with the Altec, big difference. The Altec is larger than the X-mini, (little larger than a can of tuna), and comes with a nice, somewhat hardside case, the mini, a little cloth bag. The Altec is another well built speaker. This one runs on 3 aaa batteries which for me is more flexible than a rechargable unit. Run time has yet to be determined since I have not had these units long enough to find out. I plugged the Altec into the X-Mini to make it easier to do my side by side comparison. I cranked up the volume and turned on the speakers, first the Mini. Wow, impressive, handles volume well, heck the dang thing vibrates all over table! a little tinny, mids were ok, bass was ok too. I turned down the Mini, which has its own volume control,(nice), and turned on the Altec, Wow times two!. It seem to fill the room with a much richer, deeper sound that was instantly noticable vs the Mini. I continued this back and forth, one on, one off experiment with a wide variety of music and it just kept confirming Altecs better sound. Actually, the best sound achieved was when I had both speakers on at the same time, incredible! In conclusion, I think you would have to buy 2 Minis to out due the Altec, but if I was going to buy 2 units, I would buy another Altec and a splicer. Hope this helps!"
,,Elizabeth Lowe,Altec rocks,13 Jul 2009,5.0 ,"This is a great little speaker. I bought it to hook into my son's Sansa Fuze before we went on vacation, since we were throwing a surprise luau birthday party for two family members during the trip. We recorded tropical party music on his Fuze ahead of time, then plugged it into the speaker for the party. It worked great. It's not going to be as loud as a big speaker, of course, but it suited the need. It also fits snugly into a little padded case for travel and there's a built-in recessed area for the cord, which comes with the speaker and plugs right into the MP3 player, so you don't have to worry about buying a separate cord. The cord isn't very long but it didn't need to be. He also has used the speaker when his earbuds died. I'm glad I bought this little speaker, it definitely doesn't seem to be of the ""disposable"" quality that I've heard about with other brands."
,,Michelle P,"Great sound, portable at a great price",21 Apr 2010,4.0 ,"I've really enjoyed this new gadget. I use it with my iPod nano (3rd generation), and bought it because I love to have music when I go in the backyard or to the beach with a few friends. Pros: Portable, easy to use, convenient, good protective case, very clear sound, doesn't take up the iPod battery. Cons: uses AAA batteries (not included), can't use full iPod volume - only 70% max volume, or it will ""scream"" and turn off. Would like it to be just a little bit louder, but does fill a good size room with sound. Almost as loud as my Dell laptop speakers which are great. Just a warning to make sure you don't test the full volume like I did as soon as I pulled it out the package. It basically finished the power on the batteries and I had to buy new batteries. Then I read the slip of paper inside the box that warned only to use up to 70-80% of iPod volume. Would have been nice to know before hand! But still very practical and very-used gadget. I get a lot of interested feedback from others asking me where I bought it and everyone is quite impressed with the sound coming out of such a small speaker. And for the price it is excellent!"
,,Joseph T.,IM227 vs X-Mini II,13 Jul 2012,5.0 ,"In my opinion, both the Altec Lansing IM227 (packaging says IMT227; device says IM227) and X-Mini II are well made although the X-mini has a very unique design, although smaller in size. However, the volume on the IM227 exceeds that of the X-mini by a good margin. I say this because I returned the X-mini since it was not loud enough for my needs and therefore purchased the IM227. I would venture to say that if the X-mini was the same size as the IM227 that the volume comparison would be very similar, although I still think the IM227 would win out. With regard to the quality of sound, I was satisfied with both devices but you may want to read other reviews for a more accurate description of the quality of the sound."
,,Betty the Librarian,Altec Lansing iM227 Orbit MP3 Speaker,27 Dec 2012,5.0 ,"This is without doubt the best-sounding, wireless, batteryoperated speaker I own. It is so convenient to use with music devices or portable TVs. I have a device that is attached to my cable box and when I turn the box on and its accompanying TV I can carry whatever I am watching on cable TV to any room or even the balcony. The sound on the little TV is not strong enough to hear over the water running, vacuum, etc. as I work from room to room but when I attach this little speaker it is great. Such a small but simply fantastic device. I marvel at it every time I use it. I also now own the device that charges regular batteries and I save a bundle by using regular batteries over and over and over."
,,The poor mans guide through the AMAZON,Its kind of loud,27 Jun 2012,2.0 ,"Which is the best thing i can say about this speaker. The sound quality really lacks but it is only 1 speaker trying to provide a simulated stereo sound. It does not. I also find the battery compartment very trifeling. First, it uses 3 AAA batteries. I use rechargables and its nearly impossible to charge 3 batteries. Most chargers require an even number to be charged at a time 2nd, the batteries fall out, as the metal cotacts do not grip or hold them in place. 3rd, the opening of the battery compartment is pretty easy but i always have a little trouble closing it back up. I have a general sense of dissappointment when I use it, which isn't often."
,,Spark Jonz,Just what I needed for traveling,04 May 2010,4.0 ,"I've been traveling a lot lately and wanted a small speaker system for my hotel room. This speaker was exactly what I needed! The sound is full and rich. The speaker is small and the travel case is a nice touch. I previously had some Creative Travel speakers and several low cost, worthless speakers, and this one really impressed me in its quality leap from others I have used. I tried out several new alternatives available at the audio store in the San Francisco airport and this one made my jaw drop compared to iHome's and others. My only complaint is that it is strictly battery driven. While this keeps things really simple when traveling, and the battery lasts a long time, I would like to be able to leave it on without killing the batteries. Specifically, its nice going to sleep to music, and with this speaker, I have to turn it off as I slip into sleep. But regardless, I would recommend this to anyone looking for a travel speaker. Sounds great, very portable, long battery life. Excellent!"
,,D. Hyatt,electronic accessories,27 Jun 2012,5.0 ,"This little speaker is excellent, in my opinion. I got it for my new Kindle Fire and it works very well and is quite clear and loud, for such a small single speaker. I was on a trip soon after I got this and didn`t ( and still don`t) have anything in my Kindle yet, but did try it on my Kindle, and it sounded good. I always take my laptop. I used it with my lap top and it sounded many times over, better, than the tinny sound lap top speakers always have. It has no volum control but it still suits me. You either use it with the volum on or off, right? I was out of state at a Reunion and my traveling buddy said he wants one. My brother came to my runion from another state for a short visit and he said he wanted two of them ;-)"
,,Rebekah Plantz,Awesome.,23 May 2013,5.0 ,"I was weary about buying this speaker because it was getting mixed reviews but I'm glad that I went for it anyway. I couldn't wait to try this speaker out and I am thoroughly impressed with it. I got it to listen to my ipod and to watch movies and shows on my computer. I am now watching shows with the volume on 20% instead of cranked all they way up. This speaker is amazing and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking for a speaker. As a lot of the other reviews have said, the cord is extremely short. This, however, in my eyes, is the only downside. Besides the short cord, this product is simply amazing. I fell in love with it instantly."
,,Vegas Dave,Why is the cord so &%$#%^ short?,24 Aug 2009,3.0 ,"I bought this with the intention to use it in place of larger stereo speakers on my desktop computer as I'm very short on desk space. Also to use as a speaker for my laptop as it's internal speakers are a joke. Not planning on enjoying my mp3's at high volume or other high end audio listening- I'll use my headphones for that. Overall I'm happy with the sound quality. It's far beyond what you'd expect from this small single speaker. My main problem is the tiny short cord- it's only 8"" long with no extension, so unless you want this speaker parked right next to your audio source you'll need to get an extension. Right now I have it plugged into the headphone jack of my Dell desktop and the cord isn't long enough to set it anywhere up on my desk. Oh well, I'm off now to Walmart to see if I can get a cheap cord extension."
,,Steven Newton,Amazing sound for such a compact speaker,26 Jan 2011,5.0 ,"I bought this to listen to tunes with my friends while we play disc golf. I needed a rugged speaker to go in the mesh outside pocket of my disc bag. After a quick search, this speaker looked perfect. It just came today, and I hooked it to my pc and queued up my go-to speaker torture test -- Unchained by Van Halen. Wow, this little speaker rocks! Surprising volume and bass level. The carrying case looks rugged. I'm a little concerned about the connector cable; it looks a little weak, we'll see over time. I also wish it was longer, and as long as I'm complaining over something so minor, it would be cool if the cable had a retracting reel. But whatever, you can't expect too much for such a good price. We'll also see how it does for playing time with just 3 AAA batteries. All in all, I'm thrilled with my purchase, and would heartily recommend this speaker."
,,AmaAddict,"Good sound, feels cheap",12 Jul 2011,4.0 ,"The sound is very good. It's not ""audiophile"" quality and it's mono, but it's a big step up from my netbook's built-in sound. Before, my netbook could get loud enough that I could watch a show on Hulu at 100%, but it was easily drowned out. With this, it's roughly twice as loud and now it's at a far more comfortable volume. However, I would have really liked it if this could have even gone a little louder. It's fairly compact and smaller than I thought it would be with a diameter of 3 3/8"" and a height just over 2"". When you put the batteries in, you have to really push them in until they snap. I made the mistake originally of thinking that the batteries were in place when they really weren't. The only control is a (physical) power switch. There's no volume control - you'll need your device's volume control for that. The packaging is ""environmentally friendly"" and basically requires you to destroy the packaging in order to get the speaker out. In the packaging is a lanyard - why? I don't know. Do they expect you to carry this around on your wrist? The real downside is that the audio cable feels cheap and flimsy. I hope that this will last me a long time, but I'm doubtful considering the cable. It does have a one-year warranty."
,,CBradio4carbeds,Not worth extra price just for a case: Go with iM-227,01 Sep 2011,4.0 ,"First off, I must say that I love this little speaker. It is absolutely wonderful. Having said that, after ordering the iM-237, assuming that the extra price was for more than just a case, I received the iM-227 instead. I emailed the seller telling them the problem and they told me that the only difference between the 2 is the case and the color. I told them how I thought that numbering them differently was misleading and the extra price is not worth it just for a case. I requested to be charged for the iM-227 instead, but they just mailed me the case and that was that. I love this speaker, but my suggestion would be to save some money and just buy the iM-227 instead since it's the same speaker, just different color and no cheap case to go with it."
,,C. Soda,Cool Little Speaker,10 Jun 2011,5.0 ,"This little speaker is amazing. It's small, lightweight with great sound. The first time I used it, my family was begging me to turn it down, no kidding. It's a great little speaker. I have had it over a month now of pretty steady use and no signs of the batteries giving out. Easy on/off switch. Only negative that I can find about it is that doesn't have it's own volume control. The computer or ipod that you are attaching it to is where you control the volume. No big deal in my eyes. I use it in my great room, attached to my laptop so I can listen to my favorite radio station which doesn't come in so great at home. I connect via my computer and the sound fills my the room. It's not like an expensive stereo system, but much better than my laptops speakers, so big plus."
,,DudemanLA,I like it,27 Jan 2012,5.0 ,"I use this mainly for listening to podcasts as my iPhone speaker is not loud enough and has no bass. This speaker is perfect for that. It takes 3AAA batteries. It comes with a loop to attach to the side. It's one speaker so it's better than the iPhone speaker but I wouldn't have too high expectations for music although it's pretty good. I like this better than the iHome single speaker. If you attach this to an iPhone dock you need to use the iPhone universal dock as the normal dock will disable the on screen volume controls but the universal dock you can still use the on-screen volume and use an apple remote. I don't mind the cord being short as it's easier to travel that way, and it's usually right next to the iPhone anyway. You could buy and cord extension at radio shack if needed"
,,LH,The BEST!,23 Feb 2013,5.0 ,"One day at the airport, I went into the electronics store and the person was demonstrating this speaker. At the time my old cassette recorder worked. Then it died and couldn't be repaired. Therefore I was stuck purchasing an MP3. My concern was how am I going to hear it to vocalize while I shower. The answer was even at it highest, I couldn't really hear it. Then I remembered my experience at the airport the year before. I searched for this Orbit and found it. It's WONDERFUL. I don't even have to turn the MP3 up to half, and my Orbit projects sound loudly enough that I can hear it even when in the shower. Yeah!!!!!"
,,TeamHonn,Great Speaker - Battery Only,04 May 2012,5.0 ,"This is a great little speaker. I like that it uses aaa bat. that are small and easy to carry extra ones, it requires 3. The speaker is a little bigger than I thought it would be so check the size if you want a very small speaker that folds out, this one is does not. Sound quality is really great. Also be aware that it does not have a seperate sound volumn button on the speaker itself, you have to control the sound from your device which could limit to overall volumn you are are able to get. There is no option for a AC adapter for this speaker which is the one thing that I really wish it had. Overall great little speaker. I will be looking for another one for use in hotel rooms that has a AC option, but this one will for sure be going to the beach with us and used for listening to Jimmy Buffet on XM on the back deck!."
,,"Jeff Maziarek, author of Codi's Journey",Excellent portable speaker,17 Nov 2010,5.0 ,"I bought this speaker in August 2010 along with an MP3 player that I intended to use on the beach during our vacation. While using it I found the sound quality to be quite good, and the overall construction of it is very solid. On the day it arrived I loaded the required three AAA batteries into it and they are still powering it today (mid-November) despite it being used for hours at time during the three week vacation, and several times here at home as well. The only complaint I have about this speaker is that the connecting cable is only 9 inches long; in my view a full 12-inch length would have made it even more flexible. Even with that limitation I still highly recommend this product for anyone looking for a portable speaker."
,,Consumer,5-6 Hours of Use Total... Very Bad Costumer Service,16 Sep 2013,1.0 ,"I bought this in May and once in a while used it for short times; at most my usage did not exceed 5-6hrs total; always with a lower volume and no accident happened as this speaker was on my desk all the time. In early August, once I connected it to my laptop and as I turned it on, the light was red and instead of playing the sounds there was a very loud noise. Weeks ago, I remembered that the product had a warranty and contacted the costumer service. Their short answer was that because I have not buy this product from an ""authorized seller"" the warranty is not valid anymore... They said I should contact the seller which also didn't work. Well.. good job Altec finding ways around costumers, so you sell the garbage product and make profit but you sell it to ""unauthorized sellers"" so the warranty is meaningless... and what is an authorized seller for this tiny product?!! And interestingly there are no points in which authorized sellers are mentioned in the warranty paper or their website... but who would bother taking any serious legal action for a 19$ speaker."
,,Anony Mouse,Great product!,02 Jun 2009,5.0 ,"I don't want to use earphones all the time because I don't want to be pre-maturely deaf. This portable speaker is a great solution for my audio needs. You can't expect the best audio quality from such a small single speaker but for what it's for, it serves well. To make the sound quality decent, turn off all EQ setting in your MP3 and don't turn the volumn all the way up (80% is about maximum before the sound gets distorted). It is so light weight and good looking. I can bring it to the park or the beach, have it in the car (hate the radio/MP3 converter), or use it at home. The price from Amazon is the best I can find for this product. So, what are you waiting for? Get one and save your hearing."
,,DK,best little speaker EVER !!!,30 Apr 2012,5.0 ,I was very nervous about ordering this speaker. I had looked at alot of reviews on other speakers and came across this one. Most of the reviews on this speaker were positive so I thought well if its not all its cracked up to be then I can always send it back. WELL you will not be getting it back. The sound is incredible !! Its the perfect size for travel and it fits nice in a cup holder in my car. My kids hook up thier Ipods to it and listen all day. There is no tin sound that you get with other speakers. I would definately recommend this product to other people. Please do yourself a favor and order this speaker if your looking for a good portable speaker !!
,,IllWill718,"Best Portable Speaker, Great Product!",28 May 2009,4.0 ,"Just noticed I wrote this review five years ago and guess what this speaker still works like new... I bought this speaker for me to use with my Creative Zen:M MP3 player when I'm working out in my backyard. I used it in the house for a few days and i loved it. It's loud and has great base. Doesn't sound all muffled and basey when you turn your volume all the way up. I figured that was only indoors, but i was wrong. When i finally took it outside for my workout i discovered that the sound was loud, clear, and had good base outside aslo. I now use this speaker every where, in the Kitchen, the bathroom, the laundry room etc. This is by far the (at this price)best portable speaker on the market. It also has good battery life. Battery last for 24hrs of music playing. not bad for 3 AAA's."
,,DWS,Altec Lansing iM-237 Speaker a great deal!,05 Feb 2010,5.0 ,"I really appreciate everyone who gives feedback, it's my turn. The summary: It's a great speaker for the price! Super compact with a nice case. 2 inch polypropylene cone speaker with a rubber rolled edge in an acoustically sealed enclosure (not ported); this allows for a very balanced mid-range tonal quality. Get 3 rechargeable AAA batteries and you're set for portable sound. It is loud enough and clean enough to fill a good size room as long as there is no competing background noise. I personally use the case to prop the speaker to a 45 degree angle for better sound projection in a large room. As someone already jokingly mentioned, ""it is not a replacement for a home stereo,"" but it is a great portable speaker for the price!"
,,BrooklynBeka,Great sound in a small package and affordable!,29 Jan 2016,5.0 ,"Great sound from such a little thing! okay it's not the smallest portable speaker you'll find but it delivers clear rich sound to fill a room. Great price point too! Got myself and my mom one! We use it for readings and music, the latter being my preferred use, that's when it will amaze you!"
,,Crazy Knitter,"Really impressed, nice sound, and loud!",07 Jul 2011,4.0 ,"I bought a NOOK Color a few months ago, love it, but the sound is very low, and you have to be right on it to hear it, and I have a lot of music and audio books on it, and wanted to listen while cleaning or knitting, and someone told me they had bought the Altec Lansing iM-237 Orbit Ultraportable Speaker for MP3 Players (Silver) for their Nook, so I bought it, it came this morning, I immediately plugged it in, and had to turn the sound down! All I can say, is WOW! So nice to not have to be right on top of the NC to be able to hear it. Now I can take it from room to room with me and listen to it while I am doing something else. It says the 2.5mm adapter doesn't come with it, but it did with mine, so if you want it for your cell phone, that is good. The only complaint I have (so far), is that the speaker cable is so short, I cannot hold the Nook up and read while listening to music on it. I went to the Altec Lansing website, and it says you can buy an extender cable for it, and that they come in different lengths, so that is what I will do. So far I am very happy with it. If anything changes, I will update my review. I gave it 4 stars because of the cable being so short."
,,MK,Excellent Speaker,09 Mar 2013,5.0 ,"I use this speaker to amplify my iPhone during music and movement classes I teach with babies, toddlers, and preschoolers. It works wonderfully! I can use it in any size classroom or performance room, but it probably wouldn't be good for a cafeteria, auditorium or large venue about that size. I used one for about 2 years, and finally had a fray where the speaker connected to the iPhone. I probably could have gotten it fixed, but I decided to just get a new one. Also, my husband uses one in his office to listen to his music during the day. We really love our Altec Lansing speakers! Would recommend to anyone!"
,,Lisa Stull,DON'T BUY,10 Jul 2012,1.0 ,"Received this speaker and didn't work. Must have been one of the duds some reviewers spoke of. Fine, it happens. But dealing with ALTEC IS A NIGHTMARE. Terrible customer service, made it impossible for an exchange. Will never order an Altec product again. Returned to Amazon and bought an iHome speaker which is what I should have bought in the first place. Much better reviews and sold from Amazon so if there is a problem, hopefully will not be difficult to deal with. BUYER BEWARE."
,,Mark V. Loucks,Perfect for what I wanted--the Altec portable speaker,05 Jan 2010,5.0 ,"After careful research both here at Amazon, at the Altec site, at Best Buy, and several other similar sites, I decided to buy this speaker. I have an MP3 player and a laptop which I didn't always want to be tethered to when I wanted to listen to books, music, podcasts etc. I needed something small for travel, but loud enough to be heard in my car, or a motel room, even outdoors. This little jewel of a speaker fits the bill nicely. Its loud enough to be heard in any room and even in a noisy car. I didn't want to spend $50 or more for something to listen to my MP3 in the car. I was worried this speaker wouldn't' have enough umph, but it works just fine. My wife and I carried it around on a cold winter day in late December when we were planting small trees. It was around Xmas time and we listened to the XMAS season songs I had on the Sansaclip. Even in the wind and cold, we heard the music just fine, though we did have to carry it around with us to the various spots where we planted the seedlings. It also works just fine with my laptop and belts out the music, lectures, audio books and podcasts just fine. I am very happy with it. I told a friend who also has a Sansaclip to listen to audio books, he bought one and loves it as well."
,,T. Ater,Really Pleased with this Speaker!,13 Jun 2013,5.0 ,"NOTE: Please excuse how poorly this review was written, I was trying to keep it short so it is almost just a list of facts... I had to write a review even though it will be so far down the list as to never be seen. IT was the one star reviewers that made me feel I needed to chime in. Some of them probably got a defective one, (which is frustrating) and I guess I can understand being upset and writing a bad review, but I also see people who clearly expected way too much from a tiny, battery powered $20 speaker. I also saw some from people who just don't ""get it"", so with this many reviews, you do have to expect a certain number of bad reviews. That being said, I am blown away at how good this little $20 speaker sounds! This is not a speaker to use if you are planning to blast your music in the garage as you work on your car or set on the patio table and listen to podcasts while you weed-eat! However, if you are going to play music or listen to spoken word stuff at a normal conversational, or even a bit louder level, this is a great speaker! I use it a minimum of 30 minutes a day, (usually at least twice that) while I take a shower and get ready, or when I am doing things in rooms other than the room where my computer is. I wish I could tell you how long the batteries last, but it has been so long since I replaced them I can't remember when it was. A long time is all I can say, and that is sing it at around 60% - 70% volume out of an iPod Touch. (I use regular Energizer batteries) And that includes several nights of being left on for 24 hours unplugged from the iPod. I mostly listen to audiobooks, but occasionally play music through it as well. When I have had to turn it up to around 80% - 85% to hear it over other noise in the room, it occasionally breaks up a bit with certain tones, but when it does I just bump it down until it doesn't do that, and it is still loud enough. The only quality issue (if you can call it that) that I could comment on, is you might need to take a small screwdriver or nail file, and bend the contacts in the battery case out a bit to hold the batteries more securely. The ONLY time this was needed was when I first changed the batteries, and all I had in the drawer were some cheap, off-brand batteries that had come with some other electronic device, to hold me over until I bought some new Energizers. Honestly, that was more the fault of the batteries than the speaker. The sound is crisp and clear when being used as it is meant to be used, and sounds better than any other small portable speaker I have heard, including a dual speaker AC only unit I have with an iPod dock in it. I am tempted to buy another one or two of these to keep on hand for when I finally either break, or wear this one out I love this speaker, and it is absolutely perfect for my needs."
,,Serene Night,Awesome little speaker,16 Feb 2010,5.0 ,"After my cigarette lighter adapter in my truck broke off, I rely on these portable little speakers to listen to my audiobooks in my vehicle. This one is the best I've come across. The sound is great, and it is extremely convenient to use as there are no hinges and other parts. I don't use the case, although it is quite cute. My only real complaint is I find putting the battery cover back on a bit of a challenge. I broke a small piece of plastic quite easily while trying to re-attach. It still works, though. Also, at times, my ipod will disconnect- but this could be due to motion in my car. I purchased another just to have a spare on hand. Very nice."
,,hobbiteer,Impressed,07 Dec 2011,4.0 ,"I bought both this and the M237. This speaker does have a stronger bass experience than the M237 and is also louder. However, with the volume being louder, it is more prone to distortion. The M227 does not handle the mids and highs as well as the M237. Overall, this speaker is a very impressive little thing. It definitely allows your phone to kick some tunes out and is pretty enjoyable. Just be aware that it may distort. Especially at high volumes. In the video, I started the clip with the M237, then after 34 seconds switched over to the M227. I played the same clip, at the same volume on my PC. After the the M227 had it's 34 seconds, I restarted the clip, and switched back and forth between the speakers every 3-4 seconds to show the differences. The distortion heard from my camera is wasn't noticeable when I checked it. Hope it helps."
,,mao_soup,Great little speaker,14 Nov 2010,5.0 ,"I have this and also the X-Mini II Capsule Speaker. Both are great for the price and have their own strengths and weaknesses. This speaker is bigger and not able to be stuffed in a pocket, unless it's your coat, or cargo pants. The x-mini can be stuffed in a pants pocket (for guys anyway). The orbit has better overall sound, deeper response and is louder. Also it uses aaa batteries. The x-mini is rechargeable via mini usb. Both have very long battery run times. For portability, x-mini wins easily. For better and louder sound, this orbit definetely wins. I like having both. I keep one in my room and one it the bathroom. I love these little things and use them everyday."
,,J. Atkins,Awesome product,01 Apr 2011,5.0 ,"I've used the iM-237 for a couple of years and it is one of my favorite gadgets. From in the stock room at work to hotel rooms on vacation, this little guy kicks out the jams. The battery life is phenomenal, using it every day at work 2-6 hours a day it would regularly last for over a month on the batteries. My only complaint is the lack of a dc-in port to plug it in when the batteries do run out, or if you wanted to use it stationary. That said, the price, quality, and usefulness means this is always with me when I am on the go. Volume and sound quality are great for the size; meaning its no high end receiver, but for its size it make room filling, crowd pleasing noise. I usually attach it to my iPhone and listen to Pandora, for this it is pretty much perfect."
,,M. Stefanko,I love this thing,24 Mar 2011,4.0 ,"This is the smallest, useable, speaker i've ever owned. I've been using this for a long time. The sound fills a room, and when using this with my phone...an extremely portable set up thats great for a lot of purposes. Many people have been impressed with how loud and clear this is. And although bass isnt great(why would it be with the size of this), it's been wonderful. My only major complaint is the lack of automatic shut off, or at least a better method for turning it on and off. This is a big one, button can easily be hit when in a bag, and I leave it on all the time by accident. Because of that, the batteries die a lot. Speaker itself must be pretty good for me to overlook something that causes me to buy twice the number of batteries I would be buying if it was designed well. But, really, away from that design flaw, it's fantastic."
,,VicP,Nice speaker,19 Jul 2011,3.0 ,"Very easy to use. The connecting cord is only about 7 inches long. A little longer would have been nice. 1/15/13 Update: The speaker has a little on/monitor light which is green when the unit is on and red when the unit is on and the batteries are supposedly low. I've found that on my unit the light goes red when there is still quite a lot (10+ hours) of power left in the batteries. I would recommend not changing the batteries when the light goes ""red"", but rather just keep using the speaker until the batteries don't support your desired sound volume. Also, the connecting cord is very delicate an prone to breaking. You need to be very careful with it."
,,Mike Callery,Cranks out Nicely,17 Dec 2013,5.0 ,"I've bought a few of these little speaker contraptions over time and been so-so pleased with them. This little speaker does pretty good. You are not going to get fantastic separation of sounds with a single cone speaker but it's nice. It allows me to plug it in to my iPad and catch a movie with more the decent sound. Sometimes the iPad speakers, facing away from you, just do not cut it but this does a good job and I never found a time when the sound was not clear. I would definitely recommend it and may get another."
,,David J. Atkinson,Small package - big sound,16 Oct 2011,5.0 ,"A simple concept - an amplified speaker in a can about 1/4 the size of a can of soda. One button. One plug, which stows nicely on the bottom. Plug it into your iPhone, computer, whatever. Instant portable sound that people don't have to struggle to hear. Now you don't get much of any bass from this -- you MUST have a big speaker to get good bass. But everything else is great. I use it with my iPhone to get tunes out near my BBQ or the pool, or in the car on trips for podcasts. Perfect for any voice sources like NPR. Inexpensive and a winner. Would make a great gift."
,,Prairie Crone,"great little speaker, BUT beware the banshee howl...",02 Apr 2011,5.0 ,"... when its batteries die. Don't know if they all do this, but beware when the little green indicator light turns red. When the batteries die completely (on my bedside table in the dead of night, twice now), it lets out a horrible, very loud buzzing whining noise that DOES NOT stop until you pry the not-so-easy to pry back off and remove the batteries. I guarantee this will freak everyone and their cats out the first time it goes off. Other than that, it's great. I use it instead of the rather feeble speakers on my laptop for streaming audio and video. What's nice is that you get very clear sound at lower volume levels for when you just want to watch something, not rock the house."
,,JupiterRayne,"Powerful, Portable, & Addicting!",25 May 2011,5.0 ,"Loved it. Matched up with the reviews and sounded so wonderful! Cant believe I got it for such a great cost! This speaker system requires 3 triple a batteries, and the batteries last you well over 3 days of nonstop playing. I take this with me everywhere. While I am at work I connect it to pandora and let it play music in the background. Its loud enough to give good quality sound to the whole room that is probably well over 1000 square feet. I love using it first thing in the morning while I take a shower and I also use it on nights were a nice warm bath sounds just right. I have even used it at 1 of my parties where it worked wonderfully. Everyone always asks me where I got it and I always say Amazon!"
,,ANDRES PARDO,Surprisingly effective,27 Dec 2010,5.0 ,"I just love this little speaker! Being a portable speaker, I wasn't expecting much but the sound is surprisingly good. I use in the shower (not under it :), the car, the balcony, the office. A few days ago, I and a bunch of friends ended up dancing around it, placed on the floor! I couldn't believe it! The carrying case is a definite bonus, both aesthetically and functionally. The LED signaling whether it's on or off is very useful since saving batteries is a necessity. Of course, I use and recommend rechargeable batteries. I'm even considering carrying spares. 5 Stars it deserves, but of course there's room for improvement. First, the cover; very hard to twist back on since it only accepts one given position. I noticed the USB version (not interested) has a metal clip to make it stand at ana angle - I'd love that. An option to power it with AC would be nice, but then again it goes against its portability. One last comment: The instructions mention going at most 80% volume on the device but it's impossible not to get carried away sometimes and raise to the maximum. Not a problem, at least with my Fuze (which I also love), though I'm hoping there's some circuitry that avoids damage to the speaker. Ah, great price!"
,,Maddam,Small & Convenient,17 Dec 2010,4.0 ,"This product is very useful in the bathroom, bedroom, etc. The chord that connects to the iPod from the speaker is a bit flimsy, but as long as you're careful, then no worries. Also, the off button is a bit inconvenient. The battery life on mine is about 6-8 hours. If you're someone who likes to turn the volume up all the way, then prepare for painful noises, because this little speaker cannot handle that. It's great for watching movies on a laptop. It cannot support a party, obviously. I would recommend this, because it's powerful for its size, it comes with a small carrying case (mine's almost too small for the speaker), and the chord stores conveniently at the bottom. Good buy!"
,,T.R.S.,Amazing volume and full sound in a tiny inexpensive package!,15 Jun 2011,5.0 ,"I've been using this speaker for well over a year, and I'm still amazed that it packs such a wonderful punch! It can be heard surprisingly loud for a small speaker, and even when the volume is turned up, there is very little distortion. On one set of batteries the power lasts an incredibly long time. After using it regularly for a couple of months, I started carrying an extra set of batteries just in case, but I continued to carry those spare batteries for months as the sound kept coming and the little light stayed green. The attached cord is short, but I feel that's ideal for portability purposes. Overall, if for some reason I need to purchase a portable speaker in the future, I will cross my fingers in the hope that this product is still available!"
,,Eli,Awesome travel companion,08 Jun 2011,5.0 ,"I bought this for use with my iPad. I travel internationally to the middle east where internet is slow, access is limited anyway (no hulu or netflix or any other streaming really) so I have to rely heavily on the media I bring with me. I pack my 64 gig iPad almost full of movies and tv shows, and to conserve space I buy SD content, not HD. As a result (for reasons I don't quite understand) the volume is MUCH lower on SD content, so when I am sitting on the bed of my hotel room with my iPad playing a tv show, I have it cranked all the way up struggling to hear it since it is still too quiet. This Altec Lansing speaker is THE perfect solution. It is loud, crisp and clear. It amplifies the sound the iPad gives and actually, in my opinion, makes it sound so much better. I can finally play music loud enough to actually hear it over the running water when in the shower too! Very happy with it... great build quality, comes with a nice pouch for easy travel."
,,B. Baker,Great portable Speaker for portable audio devices!,26 Nov 2011,5.0 ,"I recently bought a Motorola X2 Android cellphone and wanted better sound since the phone's internal speaker (like all cellphones) is pretty worthless for decent sounding music. I don't particularly like earbuds, so I hunted around and came up with this speaker as an alternative when I am not on the go. I am very impressed! The sound is very good and it will play at a room-filling volume without distorting. Although the bass notes won't rattle your walls, for it's small size it reproduces bass pretty well. Midrange and highs are very good. Contrast that with the phone's internal speaker which can't play music at any decent volume and can't reproduce bass notes at all, I am very satisfied with this speaker. BTW since this is only one speaker, of course it can't play music in stereo, but instead it plays a mix of both the Left and Right channels from your cellphone or other device. This speaker is small enough to easily fit into your coat pocket or backpack and uses 3 AAA batteries. I recommend it!"
,,MJD,Good little speaker,30 Dec 2010,4.0 ,"The positive reviews are accurate for this speaker. My only complaint is that the music loses too much clarity at low volume, which is how I need to listen to it at work. It's hard to hear the vocals sometimes. My old Phillips $15 speaker sounded much better at low volume, but it broke after less than a month. I have not had a problem with the Orbit accidentally turning on when in the case, as some complained. I just followed the advice of one reviewer, who said to align the on/off switch with the point where the zipper begins. I'm hoping that gentle care will prevent the cord from weakening, as some reviewers found. Overall, I recommend this speaker. At higher volumes, it sounds suprisingly good for its size. It's a good deal for the price. ADDENDUM: This speaker lasted about a year, then started making a loud, grating sound out of the blue. So factor in this information when making your purchase decision. I guess you get what you pay for."
,,C. Dideriksen,excellent for the money,16 Jan 2012,5.0 ,"This little pocket speaker is a must have for anyone who loves travelling with their music. Yes, there are better products out there if you are looking to spend over $100. However, nothing compares at this price point in terms of sound and quality. It gives a loud, full sound that easily fills a large room nicely. I use this speaker for outdoor parties, but best of all is for travelling overseas. The tiny footprint and light weight are perfect for luggage and the batteries alleviate the voltage compatibility problem. Plus if you were to accidentally lose it abroad, it is cheap enough to buy another without too much heartache."
,,Danielle Pierce,Great sound for just a little speaker!,11 Sep 2013,5.0 ,"I wanted a quality, small, portable speaker to use with my tablet, and that is exactly what I got! Like other reviewers have said, the cord is pretty short, but it's not difficult to find and attach a male/female audio extension cable to it. I like that there is a power status light to tell me when I am about to run out of battery. On that note, the batteries with which it comes only last maybe 8 hours, but I've been using namebrand batteries since and I've gotten over 24 hours out of them. Also like the carrying case."
,,arulfo,Impressed by durability and sound while driving.,06 Dec 2011,4.0 ,"I bought this speaker because I drive a classic car with a loud v8 engine and I wanted something that didn't require a large investment (like a stereo system being built into it) but still provided enough volume so I could enjoy music while driving without straining to hear it. I was impressed with the volume when I first heard it. You wouldn't expect as loud and clear a sound from a device this small normally, especially in a car with all the background noise. At times depending on the quality of the stream/music your are using, the speaker can scratch at full volume and higher frequency sound and lacks good lower end and bass sound however scratching for me was few and far between. The batteries lasted about eleven hours before the speaker volume started fading noticeably which surprised me because I had been expecting problems with the batteries much earlier with the amount of constant music I was listening to. As far as durability goes, the speaker is solid and heavy for its size, and seems well built. The only outstanding negative quality was the that the input cord is extremely short, about 4 inches. It is so short that trying to change or skip a song while driving is very difficult without moving the speaker itself, however I fixed this problem with a stereo extension cable which was about three dollars."
,,R. Gravley,Big Sound,30 Jan 2011,5.0 ,"I am not an audiophile by any means, war and motorcycling takes a toll on ones ears but they work pretty good. I got this because the ones in my laptop come from the same folks and sound very good. I had read the reviews and the problems with the chord and the battery case not closing properly. I will admit the chord does look somewhat fragile. However the battery case lid and compartment are secure and solid. I use rechargeable batteries, and am a stickler for watching which ones go low and check each one to see and it invariably involves just one battery when the red light comes on. So if you replace all the batteries you are wasting money. Just replace the low one, usually the one in the center for this device. I placed a mark where the cover turns counter clockwise and stops and the chord slot lines up. No problem with the cover any more. I must say when I 1st heard the thing I looked around the room to see where the sound was coming from. It covered the whole room. No matter where you are you get the same great sound. Sound Quality is superb for this small item. I have portable radios that don't touch this and they sound better when I hook them up to this speaker. I don't do loud but this thing acts like a slight amplifier. Sounds terrific!"
,,Aniruddha,Super performer,27 Feb 2011,4.0 ,"I read the reviews about this product before buying. Most of the reviews were very positive, so I decided to buy it, since it was available at a great price too at that time. The first thing I like was that the speaker came with its own carry bag, in which the whole thing can be packed in a compact form, which is great for taking while travel. The bag is well built. When I connected the speaker to my laptop, I was surprised by the area filling sound it produced. I immediately diconnected it from the laptop to check the difference in sound this speaker makes. The laptop speakers at full volume produced a shallow sound, however, as soon as the speaker was connected, the sound was rich and deep. Movie watching at hotel rooms is now a real pleasure. The bass is great for a speaker of this size.The cons of this speaker is that there is no volume control, only on/off button. Also the connection cable is really short. I was trying to place it in the center position with respect to the screen, but the cable was short. However, if there was any imbalance between the sounds coming to my right and left ears, it was not perceptible. So I was OK with that. Overall, I am satisfied with the purchase. If you want to carry a tiny speaker and still want to hear big sound, buy this speaker."
,,John P. Gelinas,I did not hear the sound of music,26 Jun 2017,1.0 ,I bought this to listen to my IPod while I was outside on my patio and found it to be a shoddy piece of merchandise. One can only listen to music on it at a low volume; if you turn it up the sound is very distorted. Buyer beware!
,,It’s me!!!,Great for the price for a mid-volume speaker.,13 May 2016,5.0 ,"Sounds gets a little off at max volume, but this isn't really a high-volume speaker anyways. Perfect for a few friends at the beach, River, camping, or at a picnic. If you aren't looking for something super loud, this works great."
,,Cananboy,Compliments from the Audience!,12 Jan 2013,5.0 ,"We purchased these as my wife tends to give a lot of presentations using videos and powerpoint. She'd run into one too many places that had either no or inadequate speakers, so she bought this little guy in case. Now it's all she uses. Even in larger rooms, it's been great; it's small, compact, the cord coils up nicely, and it provides good quality sound and volume for its size. Audiences and presentation hosts have praised her for being so well prepared and making sure everyone can hear video and audio without straining in a room full of people."
,,AD,Totally worth my money,11 Sep 2010,5.0 ,"I bought this little speaker as a hook-up for my iTouch and/or laptop while I am at college. I didn't want your regular desktop speakers because I don't necessarily plan on using speakers all that much anyway with a roommate and all. Needless to say, this little guy has a lot to offer a woman in need of a basic speaker. It's ultra easy to use, portable enough to fit in my backpack or purse, but also has enough va-va-voom to wow anyone who listens to it. Of course, the bass is somewhat lacking, but I just adjusted the sound settings on my ipod to make the sound quality pretty good. In order to get the free shipping deal, I ordered a basic splitter and might come back to buy another one of these little speakers to plug into the splitter for a little extra kick. Great purchase--I would definitely recommend!"
,,J. Bewley,Great portable travel unit,02 Sep 2011,5.0 ,"If your looking for a small solution for music, this thing is excellent. I actually bought it for traveling (We actually have the bose portable sound dock...which is too big if you're going to do just one carry on bag or a backpack only)....I hook it up to my ipad for movies if i'm in a hotel room. Sound is better than average and def. able to fill up a room with music. Keep in mind, this thing would not cut it for a party or anything.....but works well for portable sound. 1 set of batteries ran ours for a week on vacation in Mexico...we used it for a couple hours each night.... A+"
,,RWM,Mighty Mite!,28 Oct 2012,5.0 ,"This speaker is awe inspiring, you won't believe your ears! I have been an Altec-Lansing fan since I was a retail sales person at a small Hi-Fi shop in Omaha 25 years ago. They were audiophile quality speakers back then, and although the brand doesn't have the same cache it used to, these speakers are a testament to the quality and value still inherent in the brand. They use AA batteries, and are energy misers, they have run all night for me on three batteries. The sound is awesome and never fails to impress. Everyone who listens to them can't believe it. I know at least three of my friends who went right to Amazon.com and bought one for themselves! Highly recommended!"
,,Nickboughtit,"These speakers rock...for the money don't expect tons of sound but they do provide good tone and batteries last really long,",30 May 2013,5.0 ,"i did a lot of homework on these...the batteries last forever (watch for accidentally pushing the button on though, they should have added a lock for that or an auto shut off.) and they are pretty loud...I bought 2 and used a splitter from my iPod to power both of them...great on the beach, the campsite, the porch, the boat or anywhere you need tunes. I throw them in the back pack...about the size of a medium pork and beans can and lighter than the ipod. Not the sound quality or out put of jawbones jam box but about $150 less."
,,Brian J. Ramirez,"very loud, and very portable, and affordable",12 Apr 2012,4.0 ,"I don't normally review products but i felt the need to share my thoughts on this item. The Altec Lansing Orbit IM227 is a great portable speaker. I bought this for the sole purpose of listening to this speaker outside. I have the older Altec Lansing VS4121 system and although they are very loud and very good quality they are not portable AT ALL and especially not enough for me to take outside when I grill, swim, or clean the pool. I wasn't expecting such huge sound to come out of such a tiny speaker. It was loud and clear and had a decent amount of bass for something that fits in the palm of your hand. despite the competitors having a rechargeable battery equipped, this takes 3 AAA batteries but does come in handy when you are running out of power, just replace them with new ones and you are good to go. no hassle finding a USB port to charge the speaker. Other users complain about the size being too big compared to other portable speakers. I find the size of this speaker is an advantage because it does not move around like the iHome or the x mini II at high volume or bass heavy songs. All in all this is a great investment if you are looking for a portable speaker with great sound quality. PROS: loud, clear, portable, 24 hour battery life, compatible with any device with 3.5mm audio connection. CONS: no protective case, cord seems flimsy,"
,,Bv11,Very happy with this speaker,02 Mar 2015,5.0 ,"I'm very happy with this speaker. The sound quality is fantastic, and the size is convenient. Some reviews complain about the sound not being loud enough. This speaker does actually get decently loud, but a speaker of its size does have some limitations. My dad also purchased many small portable speakers on Amazon for around $10, and none of them could compare to this speaker. It's a great product for a reasonable cost."
,,Amazon Customer,cheap+cheerful,22 Nov 2009,4.0 ,"Pretty good for the size, and good battery lifetime. I use it mainly for listening to audio books in a car with no sound system (more exactly, one so old it is beyond help). The Landsing hangs by its biner from the cup holder, and I plug in a Palm Treo, and audio books from Audible come up loud and clear even at freeway speeds. I've had it about a month and the first set of AA batteries are still chugging away. It clips the sound a little at the volume needed on the freeway, but still acceptable. If it were 25% bigger diameter to give that bit more power so it didn't clip, it would get five stars, but it's still pretty satisfactory, so four stars it is."
,,profoundquiet,Exactly what I expected!,23 Aug 2009,5.0 ,"Even after reading the positive reviews, I was skeptical as to whether this speaker would fit my needs. I needed to use this for an outdoor tabling event where there were no electric outlets nearby. There would also be other tables around, so it would result in a loud atmosphere. I needed the speaker to play loud enough so that people in the area could hear the music over the multitude of conversations. I am happy to say that this speaker fit all of my expectations, and even more! It's compact, battery-powered, plugs into mp3 players/computers, and plays clear audio. It's surprisingly loud and clear for such a small speaker. There's very little static or background noise. I'm no sound expert, but this speaker covers the ranges pretty well. I can hear the high-pitches and bass very well. I was expecting it to be a bit larger, about the size of a good-sized bagel. But it turns out it's about half that size, about muffin size. Which is great, because it's easier to carry around now. The only downside is that the 3.5mm audio input is fairly short, about 8.5 inches. It would be nice if the cable were a bit longer. I definitely recommend this for anyone who is in need of a speaker without an outlet in the area. It's a great product!"
,,JRswishhh,Good for what it is.,23 Jul 2011,5.0 ,"I have had this little speaker for about 3 weeks now. I use it just about everyday, whether I'm in the shower, washing my car, or just chilling in bed. I was ecstatic the day I received it in the mail but at the same time, I had moderate expectations. I opened the package and it came with a nice pouch and a pair of AAA batteries, which I am still using. Anyways, I plugged it into my Sansa Sandisk E280 and I was quite surprised by the loudness of the speaker. Some reviewers have said that at full volume the speaker starts distorting; but when I bumped my E280 to full volume, I did not notice any sort of distortion whatsoever. I guess that aspect varies between different media players you connect it to. I mainly listen to R&B, Hip-Hop/Rap, and Pop music and it sounds fine across these genres. But if you're a bass-freak, this speaker will not satisfy your needs. This would be decent for small backyard kickbacks, picnics, or self-listening. Overall, I am happy with my purchase. When I bought it in the end of June, it was only $20 from Amazon but it has since been raised to $28, wow. For that price, I would recommend you to check out the FiiO S9, which are stereo speakers."
,,Sunny Dayz,Highly recommend,29 Jun 2011,5.0 ,"Compact & portable. Have used almost daily for the past 3 wks, including 10 days at the beach, and haven't had to replace the batteries yet! It provIdes a really good sound without projecting too far & disturbing others. No distortion that I've noticed, even at max volume. Had others ask where I purchased it. UPDATE 11/20/12: Still using this several times per week with no problems or degredation of sound quality. I was recently watching the Ghost Adventures show on television, and noticed they were using this same speaker on one of their investigations(!) I continue to be highly satisfied with this product."
,,A. Neff,"I'm very picky, but I give this thing the green light.",25 Mar 2010,5.0 ,"I just got this in yesterday. Our first child is due in the next few weeks, and my wife wanted to have some music to listen to during the labor process at the hospital. We have an 8GB Sansa Clip loaded with our favorite music, but I wasn't sure how I'd be able to play the music without lugging some 80's style boombox (with an aux input) on my shoulder into the hospital. Enter this Altec Lansing device, a gem in the rough. Obviously, right out of the box I was curious to test out the sound. This thing easily fits in the palm of your hand, and already comes equipped with a 10"" aux connecting cable that wraps neatly inside the bottom of the speaker so you don't have to buy your own. The box says the battery life will last for up to 24 hours on 3 AAA batteries, though I haven't tested that claim yet. There's only an on/off button on the speaker, so you have to adjust the volume using the mp3 player itself. Personally, I like the simplicity, because I had streaming music in 15 seconds out of the box. The music quality is pretty good considering the size. If you expect something booming and crystal clear out of a portable speaker with a 2.5 inch diameter, good luck because it doesn't exist. Honestly, I thought this thing would be a one-time use item, but am now excited for the possibilities. For practical purposes this device has countless applications. I can throw it under the stroller, take it to the beach, and put it on the picnic table during BBQs. It even comes with a carry case with strap and caribiner clip. I'm not easily impressed... but I'm impressed."
,,Anne Royall,"Small size, great sound",29 Nov 2012,5.0 ,"This is the second of these mini-speakers that I have purchased. I thought I would just leave one permanently in my vacation home. I got one maybe a year ago because I listen to a lot of audio books via CD or my iPhone and don't like to use earphones. I just don't think they are that good for your hearing. This little device delivers great sound and will improve the quality of your experience with CDS, and iPad, iPod, iPhone or other listening device. It is pretty study. The cord on my first one frayed slightly after much use, but was easily fixed with a bit of electrical tape. My only caveat is that the cord is way too short, as seems to be the case with most of these mini-speakers."
,,Aristides,Great addition to MP3 player,25 Dec 2008,4.0 ,"I bought the iM-237 to use with my MP3 player at work. I had never before used external speakers with the MP3. This little guy was a pleasant surprise. I've been using it for some two weeks now and have no complaints whatsoever. Sound is rich and vibrant. Music sounds like ... music (!) and podcasts sound crisp and perfectly clear. The unit's weight is next to nothing and I don't know I'm carrying it, either in my satchel or my (hunting) vest pocket. I have only two minor complaints: there's no volume knob and the jack cable is too short. Other than that, this is one superior little gadget and well worth every last penny you'll spent on it."
,,Rotor Pilot,"Not bad, but not great",16 Feb 2011,3.0 ,"I was disappointed with the sound. It didn't seem as rich as some reviewers have suggested, and I tried a range of music genres. It's a solid unit but it's bigger than I'd expected (by the way, the dimensions listed in the product description are for the package box, not for the speaker itself, so for anyone wondering: 3.5"" diameter x 2"" tall). Tucked into the zippered case, I found it too bulky to toss into my brief bag. I opted for the Veho360: a couple dollars more, with bluetooth, but half the size. Granted it doesn't sound as good as the 237 but it's surprisingly good for the size, which is far easier to toss into my kit. And the volume is at least as good.

,,Timmy,Great sound,13 Jun 2012,4.0 ,"I purchased this for my car. My radio got ripped out and didnt want to spend the amount of money to replace it so purchased this along with a mp3 player and it works just fine. I tried with several different genres of music including rap, country and pop. I am very happy to report both sound and bass were very well reproduced. The device is small and the speaker can deliver great sound. The only negative I can point out is the stupidly short cord to connect the mp3 player with. You can get an extender for this so only a small negative. Overall very happy."
,,marie,Easy to use,16 Apr 2013,5.0 ,"This little speaker is very easy to use. Just put the batteries in, plug the cord into the ear phone jack of whatever device you choose, and voila, instant music through the speaker. I can carry it around from room to room easily. I ordered a second one-one for upstairs and one for downstairs because I like it so much. It requires no software, no set up, etc-easy as pie to use. A couple of comments. I have purchased 2 of these, and found that the battery cover, on the bottom of the speaker, is difficult to put on. It took me several tries to get it on after I inserted the batteries. The cord is only a few inches long, so your device needs to stay directly beside the speaker. There is no volume control on the speaker itself, you need to control the volume through your device. This is not ideal, because you must remember to turn the volume back down when you unplug your device. Lastly, while I think the sound quality is very good, this device will likely not meet the standards of someone who is particular about audio quality. The sound is a great quality for my needs and for the price, but if I were looking for a device with high quality sound, I would invest much more money in a speaker."
,,Beverly,Perfect for its purpose,26 Jun 2009,5.0 ,"Lots of people are audiophiles. For me, however, spending big bucks on a Bose to deliver the music from the iTouch I was given (what a great gift) seemed like overkill. I wanted a nice little speaker that I could easily move from kitchen to living room. The clarity of sound seems excellent to me. Maybe I'm not an audiophile. The price was right; I got five free downloads, as well. Uses ordinary batteries. The only reason I hesitated at giving it five stars is because it's round. If I must turn off the speaker in a hurry because the phone is ringing, I've got to hunt for the off button sometimes. Otherwise, it's a five star buy in a four star body."
,,Tim Langanke,"Small, compact....but has a punch!",07 Apr 2010,5.0 ,"I was looking for a some speakers to take to the beach. I know Altec Lansing's audio quality having bought computer speakers previously, so since they were on sale, I figured I would give this little guy a shot. Surprisingly, it was awesome. Great sound. A little distortion when at full volume, but for the most part, if you are looking for speakers for a trip, for your room etc, this little guy packs a powerful punch. ONE LAST NOTE. Had I been thinking about it, I would have bought a splitter and another speaker for the full effect, which I plan on doing. I don't know how that will turn out, but I would imagine, two is always better than one. Enjoy these....I know I do! Tim Langanke San Antonio, TX"
,,Amazon Customer,"Good Sound, Good Size",27 Oct 2010,5.0 ,"As mentioned in other reviews, the cord is way to short. You would need to buy an extension which would then not wrap in the space provided and would then be an extra piece to carry. I also find that there are times when I wish it was louder. Depending on the preamp in the device connected, you can overload the amp, but then you get significant distortion from what is otherwise a very clean speaker. This is the first speaker I grab when I need portable sound. I have a number of them, most costing much more. It's combination of sound quality and portability are hard to beat."
,,RUSH2112,Altec Lansing iM227 Orbit MP3 Speaker works as advertised.,07 Feb 2013,4.0 ,"Altec Lansing iM227 Orbit MP3 Speaker is the perfect accessory for any MP3 player or product needing a small external speaker. I get tired of sticking ear buds in my ears and head phones are not always convenient either. I also like the ability to hear my surroundings without interference. It’s often a safety issue and closing off your hearing completely can leave you vulnerable at times. This product works as advertised. I paid about $24 and now see them for less, making them an even better deal."
,,Reds Fan,Exellent Price to Quality Value,24 Aug 2010,5.0 ,"I purchased this with only a couple of simple uses in mind. This was for occassional use listening to music in a golf cart, poolside and at the beach; also for lengthy, listen-only conference calls (from my cell). I wanted a cheap, small speaker(s) with as good a sound as possible (for the size and money). I also wanted something I didn't have to worry about breaking or losing (ala left in a golf cart or damaged at the beach). After looking at a slew of bluetooth units in the $40-$75 range, I paid $23 for this, thinking that if it sounded bad or the cord was an issue I could just return it and nothing lost. I've used it a couple of dozen times now (2 week beach vacation, golf, pool, etc.), and have to say that this was a great buy. The sound was much better than I expected. There isn't a ton of volume or depth here, but I already have a fantastic sounding portable dock for different uses. This unit is for personal listening in public places (public pool, golf course, etc.) where too much sound isn't necessary or even desired. Loud enough to sound impressive for its size (not tinny), but not going to fill a room or patio with thumping music (my IM600 does that). By the way, a set of 3 AAAs lasts forever, even at high volumes. I vowed to buy a few for gifts (mostly friends that saw/heard mine and commented), but I see the price went up $10 to $33. I'll wait for a drop, but definitely will purchase these as gifts."
,,Amazon Customer,What's the big deal?,13 Jun 2011,3.0 ,"The sound is not so rich and full as expected from all the great reviews. I'd say the sound is true to its small size. Not a bad choice if you want to tote along some background music for a lazy day. I gave it 5 stars for the ""portability"" rating, but only 3 stars overall. Mine seems to have a bad circuit and will stop playing after about an hour until you give it a light shake - even with good batteries. I'm considering returning it. I own several other Altec Lansing speakers which I've been very happy with. The Orbit speaker fell a bit short of expectations for me. It runs on 3 aaa batteries and sounds like it. I guess I was expecting Altec to do some magic with that little amount of power - oh well."
,,Wayne Yoshida,Very good sound quality for its size,19 Apr 2011,4.0 ,"Although a bit ugly and slightly large for a ""ultraportable"" speaker, the Altec Lansing's iM-237 Orbit speaker generally lives up to my expectations for sound quality. First, the good: sound is very good compared even to speakers several times its size. The speaker is pretty loud considering it's powered by three AAA batteries - it's not a boombox but it's no slouch, especially indoors. The strength of the speaker is in its midrange, in the frequencies important to human vocals. On this speaker, vocal parts are especially strong performers, and the speaker can sound as good as a home sound system when listening to spoken word, such as public radio/NPR. The low and midbass is of course fairly weak but it doesn't suddenly rolloff and still has a pleasant response in lower frequencies. I get the feeling that they could have pushed for more bass if the speaker weren't on batteries. Similarly, trebles are not crystal clear, but do a good job of emphasizing the melody instead of sounding overdriven and tinny like they usually do in cheap tiny speakers. However, the visuals leave much to be desired. The aluminum/grey plastic speaker looks like a cheap electronic gizmo that they give out free at conferences. Those exposed hex screws scream ""I'm made in China and look like it!"" You can buy a customized patterned label to pretty up the sides, but this just about doubles the price. Finally, you may want to look at the pictures carefully: it's quite a bit larger than you would think, about the size of a narrow but tall (1.5"") double hamburger. It's still hand-sized, but just barely. Backpack yes, pocket no. Portable, not ultraportable - the difference may be significant to some. For my purposes, it looks like it will work out just fine."
,,SFerrell,good deal but not great performance,10 Nov 2009,3.0 ,"for $18 this is a good deal; however, very basic (1 cable, 1 power button, no volume control) and performance is not great. it's fairly loud - loud enough that i can hear it while i'm in the shower, which is the reason i got it. but when receiving low frequencies the speaker sometimes outputs noise/fuzz. i don't know why they included a mini-subwoofer other than looks. they should have completely filtered out the low frequencies, in my opinion, considering it often creates annoying noise. i plan to return and buy a better performing (and unfortunately more expensive) speaker system...maybe with radio included."
,,Sarah,GREAT sound,03 Apr 2012,4.0 ,"I got this for my 11-year-old to plug her little iPod into. I didn't need to get a pricey speaker for just a kid's room, so I went with a cheap one (price has actually gone up since we bought it, which is the ONLY reason that I did 4 stars instead of 5). I borrowed it once to give me some music while painting the kitchen, and I could not believe what great sound it had. I mean, this thing isn't going to replace a full-blown stereo, but I can't imagine a typical person having the need for better sound than this produces."
,,Fudman,A Great Small Portable Speaker,24 Aug 2011,5.0 ,"For a really small lightweight portable speaker, this unit cannot be beat. It exceeds expectations. I bought 3 of these, one for myself and one for each daughter prior to a 12 day cruise. They LOVED having the ability to play their iPods in their rooms. It could easily get loud enough to disturb the neighbors. Everyone who hears the speaker is amazed at the sound quality for such a tiny enclosure. The clarity and definition is actually very good. While bass is somewhat lacking (nothing small will generate adequate bass), it is more than adequate for such a tiny speaker. The metal screen mesh ensure you won't damage the cone during transport. I used a fly reel case to protect it. It is simply the best sub-$20 accessory you can buy for an iPod user. I got well over 20+ hours on a single set of AAA batteries. This would make a great present/stocking stuffer!"
,,amazonfan,This speaker really sounds terrific with my IPOD and will be easy to travel ...,13 Mar 2015,5.0 ,"This speaker really sounds terrific with my IPOD and will be easy to travel with. Very clear, crisp sound with plenty of volume. Great quality for the price! Update: We took this with us for 3 weeks on Hawaii. It worked great! We only played music for a couple of hours in the evenings but the batteries held up throughout. I am very happy and would highly recommend it!"
,,Richard Talada,Low Volume,24 Mar 2010,2.0 ,"Be cautious when purchasing this product. It gives nearly adequate volume with some players, but not all. I tried it with several players, and never did the volume overpower the small speaker. With some players, the sound was so distant when the player volume was maxed, it was difficult to know if the unit was turned on. Evidently the manufacturer saw no need for a volume control on this unit, because its top volume would never be loud enough. Users should have more control over the volume, than just cranking it to a maximum, and being satisfied with unsatisfactory results. Altec Lansing iM-237 Orbit Ultraportable Speaker for MP3 Players (Silver)"
,,Robert Taylor,Great little speaker!!!!,25 Dec 2011,5.0 ,"I've been using this for a few months now and I really like it. I use it for enhancing the sound on my iPhone & iPad and Laptop. I primarily use for watching ""shows"" with speaking, Netflix, etc... Music sounds good too. Just keep in mind it's not a home stereo system and it's not one of the $300 portable speakers. I've had really good luck with battery life. I've listened to hours and hours of music and watched several movies on one set of batteries. Sorry, I can't tell you the exact number of hours they lasted, but I certainly don't think battery life is an issue. It sounds really good for its size and the price. I'd definitely get another one if / when I need it. No regrets!"
,,DISCOZOOM,Fantastic Little Speaker,12 Oct 2012,5.0 ,"I just compared it to my SONDPEX 10-pound speaker and this little one beats it. The SONDPEX has a lot of hum to it and it's not only heavy, but also bulky and requires a DC plug in. The Altec-Lansing iM227 has a much more crisp sound with zero hum and like others mentioned here, it fills the room! Really packs a wallup for it's size. Obviously, it's very portable too. My only complaint, and it's minor, regards the 3.5mm connection cable attached to the speaker. There is no way to replace it if it gets damaged without opening up the unit, so you have to be careful not to ever pull hard on the cord or allow your pet to chew on it. Keep this speaker in a safe place. I would much prefer a 3.5 input jack instead of a thin cord because they are not as prone to damage. Otherwise, this speaker is the bomb and I plan to use it on Halloween for sound effects outside (weather permitting). I use (and recommend) re-chargeable batteries which are easy to come by and inexpensive."
,,Andrew W.,Great Sound short audio jack,23 Jul 2012,4.0 ,"This little speaker puts out great sound, especially for its size. For me the limitation of the short audio jack cable made it not as user friendly. The cord is long enough if you are going to just leave your device sitting next to the speaker, but I use it with my phone and listing to various streaming media so I like to pick my phone up a lot and you just don't have much room to manuver. All that being said, if you are not going to buy a top of the line bluetooth speaker and are mostly worried about quality sound for a good price. This is a great choice."
,,J. Kim,Works well; nice and compact,06 May 2009,5.0 ,"Works well. Long battery life and sounds good. Nice touches are the included case and the strap for the speaker. The only negative is the cord is kind of short. Because it's short, I have to put the speaker over to the left side of my laptop instead of behind it or over to the right because my speaker port is on the front but the left side of my laptop. Also, you can't listen to it too loud since the sound will get very distorted. Would I recommend it? Yes. The only thing I like a little more because it is true stereo but more expensive is the IHOME Rechargeable Satellite Mini Speakers. I bought that one for my daughter. It does sound better. http://www.amazon.com/IHOME-Rechargeable-Speakers-iPods-Black/dp/B001JHSD3Y/ref=pd_sim_e_1"
,,oukatie,Right in line with my expectations,16 Feb 2011,5.0 ,"I previously purchased a different portable speaker for my ipod and it wasn't even as loud as my ipod. Needless to say, I had to search again and if you've been looking, you know that there isn't a wide variety of truly portable speakers to choose from, especially if you want something that ships with Prime (I refuse to pay for shipping from Amazon since I pay for Prime). I was looking for something small enough to fit in my purse so I can take it to my classroom and back home when I know I'll be working late and want to listen to some music to make the time fly by. This definitely fits the bill. I was pleasantly surprised by the sound quality and volume this thing can put out. It should go without saying that the sound isn't amazing but I am more than happy with it given the size and price. Obviously you won't be getting Bose or better with this thing but if that's what you are after, add some zeros to the price and have fun. The case is very nice. Overall, I'm very pleased with this speaker. If you are looking for something in this price range that is small enough to throw in a bag but can still put out a pretty good volume and sound, this is what you should buy."
,,J. Walton,Audiophiles - PLEASE READ,05 May 2010,5.0 ,"All in all, this is a fantastic product. For its price and size, you are not going to find better construction or sound. I was unwilling to purchase it, however, because there is no way I would accept a mono configuration. Following a few very insightful reviews here on Amazon, I simply purchased a product like this to remedy the situation. I was a bit skeptical about the wiring configuration of the splitter at first, even given the red/white colors, but when I first fired up the intro to AC/DC Hell's Bells, I confirmed that it properly splits left/right. Of course you will need to purchase two speakers, but you will get true stereo sound. As noted in the other reviews, you can fit the splitter in one of the cases, clip the cases together, and you are set. Obviously, having two speakers not only gives you stereo, but also gives you a great volume boost. I rarely rate a product 5 starts, but this one gets it."
,,Ms. TPot,How Sound Should Be!,31 Mar 2012,5.0 ,"I was looking for a speaker to play my mp4 while in the bathroom. Something not too big, with quality sound. My friend recommended I purchase this Altec Lansing and I couldn't be happier. The speaker projects ideal treble and bass, loudly. My music maintains the sound quality of the original format. The battery usage is also excellent. I play this speaker for no less than two and a half hours with each use and I've already used it a dozen times! Even when the battery strength light turned red, the speaker continued to play eight hours and I have yet to change them. ...maybe they're just good Duracells, but I'm willing to bet on the efficiency of the Altec's energy usage. The only improvement needed would be to make the speaker operate with an AC adapter that recharges a removal battery (so the batter could be replaced over time). Altec Lansing is still one of the greatest speaker manufacturer's of our time!"
,,Dylan,Wow! Dynamite DOES come in small packages.,18 Apr 2011,5.0 ,"I couldn't believe the sound that came out of this thing when I turned it on. It's extremely lightweight, and simple. The sound is almost perfect. My parents and brother couldn't believe the sound that came out of it either. I'm bringing this with me for my Peace Corps service and it will be great to have my music and it will sound great too! Simple short cord to plug in your ipod or computer, 3 AAA batteries, on/off button, and sweet case that comes with it is nice too. Zips right up and provides good protection for the speaker. Well balanced sound and a steal at $25."
,,Kindle Customer,we use this for white noise for baby,20 Jun 2012,4.0 ,"Our baby needs some white noise to help him sleep best, and since I had an MP3 player and didn't want to invest in a ""white noise machine"" (less versatile), I decided to try this out (per a friend's recommendation). It's worked out well. We finally purchase rechargeable batteries, since we let it run all night. But the thing will run for over a week of 12hr nights & 3-4hr naps each day before the batteries need changed (about 112hrs). The best part is that I can tuck it in a netting ""pocket"" of his diaper bag, and put him in his pack'n'play, and he will go down for a nap anywhere! I do wish it could plug into the wall. Aw, well. Edit: my one complaint is that every once in a while, I have had to adjust the connectors for the batteries. Instead of springs, they used metal connectors that can bend in too far for the battery to make a good connection. They just have to be bent out, but it's a bit frustrating when you know you're putting in fresh batteries and it's still not working."
,,C. Thomas,Very impressed...,07 Jan 2012,5.0 ,"... and I don't impress easily with audio stuff. I'm a music nut with a long trail of audio hardware behind me, and almost all the portable speakers I've tried are tinny and way too quiet. This little speaker though, it gets LOUD! I can hear it even when I'm standing right next to the air pump at work. Speaking of work... I got this speaker to carry around in my car, just in case I needed one (told you I'm a music nut...) But last week at work the word came down that we had to take down our sound systems because some people on 1st shift could NOT keep from turning it up too loud. So I tried this speaker out and found it fits just perfectly snug in a standard t-shirt front pocket, with my Cowon iAudio 7 below it. :-D Which brings me to battery life - I tried this speaker out (at a volume that would override the air pump) for 3 hours on Tuesday, then used it for a full work shift Wednesday, Thursday and Friday - and it's STILL PLAYING! I had bought a 20-pack of AAA batteries, but it's still playing on the same three AAA batteries I started with at the first of the week. I don't know yet when they will die, but I'm guessing a 20-pack will last me a good month at work. Its predecessor, the Altec Lansing iM207, I used one time on a desktop computer I was tinkering with, just to get some sound out of the computer while I was working on it, without setting up a speaker system. Then I finished tinkering with the computer and walked away, forgetting to turn the speaker off. About a week later I turned the computer back on and was surprised to hear the Windows music playing... the little hockey-puck looking speaker was still on and still plugged into the computer. If you're reading this then you probably browsed to this page in search of a good portable speaker. Get this one! Shoot, at that price get two or three and connect them together."
,,koala50,Great little speaker,31 Oct 2011,5.0 ,"I wasn't looking for anything fancy, I just wanted good sound and this little speaker fits the bill. I have a Teac system in the main park of the house but I wanted something to use in the bathroom when I'm getting ready in the morning. It had to have good sound, be small and easy to use and be easy to move in and out of the bathroom because I didn't want to store it in there (so much humidity). I keep this little speaker in my night stand drawer (with my ipod) which is right by the entrance into the bathroom. I grab both, turn on the Ipod, plug it into the speaker and great sound comes out, easy as that. If you're looking for concert quality sound, this is not for you, but I like to think I appreciate good sound when I hear it and this speaker can hold its own for what it is."
,,Nick Newport,Just WOWW!!!!!!,23 Jun 2012,5.0 ,"Ive read all the the amazing reviews for this product and i said okay ill buy one thinking it was just a little better than my phone and laptop speakers man was i wrong. Pros; 1. This little speaker pumps soo much deep high quality sound that its shocking my parents said they even heard in the kitchen. 2. Great sound quality it has Deep Pounding Bass. Great Mid's and Acceptable High's. 3. Great for Bike riding, Walking on the street, Hiking, you name it this little guy will be perfect. 4. I like the Design even though the housing is plastic it feels great and its light. You dont want aluminum because it adds unnecessary weight and adds to the price. Cons; 1. Requires 3 Tripple A batteries which is awkward because most places sell either 2 pack or 5 packs. 2. Not Rechargeable not going to take a star off because i like this because if i go camping all i do is replace the batteries and camp wood has no AC Outlets lol. 3. A little bigger the X Capsule which i not a big deal to me. 4. At High Volume the Quality Degrades big time so make sure you use High Quaility Files like (AAC, Flac,AIFF,WAV,MP3) To get better quality at higher volumes. 5. Flimsy Cable Conclusion; This little speaker delivers so much BOOM you will be surprised, I listen to House, Dance, Trance, HipHop and all those songs sound great i use to commute from place to place. When i Hike or go bike riding. The battery last a long time."
,,L. Millman,iM-237 - Disappointing performance,29 Dec 2010,1.0 ,"This is the second of these we've bought - returned the first one, which stopped playing well after a couple of weeks. The second one held up a little longer, but really not worth the expense - it now makes skreechy static which sounds like some kind of interference - I've taken batteries out, replaced them...have no idea why it's not working, but I can't recommend it. Too bad - I know their higher priced electronics have a good reputation."
,,PostParty,Ok for the price.,13 Dec 2009,3.0 ,"I bought this speaker to connect to my Ipod for use when I am playing frisbee golf outdoors. I keep the Ipod and the speaker in my backpack while playing. At first, I was impressed with how loud the little speaker got and the sound quality is OK for it being a cheaper single unit. I did quickly realize that the volume on the Ipod needed to be turned down to 75% or so otherwise the speaker distorted the music. My major complaint with the unit, and the reason I am giving it 3 stars is battery life and sound distortion. The unit claims it can go 24 hours on 3 AAA batteries, but I have found this to be untrue. I have used several different batteries from cheap to more expensive name brands and have found a maximum of 12 hours or so play time. Whats worse is that as the battery wears down the sound become more and more distorted until it is almost unlistenable near the end of battery life. That wouldn't be so bad, but there is also no realy way to tell when the batteries are getting low until the distortion happens which is inconvenient since I don't carry batteries around all the time with me while playing a sport. Pro's are that its very durable so far, easy to use, and loud on fresh batteries. I wish I would have gotten a different product, but this did work well enough for 1 summers. I will be looking into getting different speakers next year, possibly ones that have a lithium ion rechargeable battery so that I don't have the same problems with battery life and sound distortion."
,,Stephen,Terrific,22 May 2012,5.0 ,"This is my 2d little speaker for my MP3 player. My first was adequate, until I dropped it and loosened something so it was irritating to listen to. This AltecLansing, however, is great. LOUDER (uses batteries, the first did not) so EASY to hear in the car where I use it, CLEAR - always easy to understand (I listen to books), a pleasure. As soon as I heard it, I wanted to write a rave review. Very highly recommended. [The speaker is tops. But trying to register it, at their site, was impossible. Even trying to email them with their form was impossible. They ask for information about the product but the choices are limited and do not match what I know from the speaker itself. Ridiculous. Buy the speaker but forget about trying to register it.]"
,,31Alpha,Wow,07 Oct 2010,5.0 ,"Who would have thought that such a small speaker could sound so good or that I would so quickly embrace mono sound? I bought this to share music in my workplace with my coworkers, thinking that other people would bring in their iPods/MP3 players. It was an awesome plan, but this my Altec Lansing speaker has been so popular, other people have taken it back to their offices to use it themselves and for movies when off work. This thing is great. I wish I had bought one sooner--the ability to hear clean sounding music outside of headphones when away from home is great."
,,HookC,Small but Terrific,25 Jul 2010,4.0 ,"Skepticism because of its size--and having to forget about stereo separation--quickly gave way to almost total satisfaction. The iM-237 is ideal for travel, provides more than acceptable sound quality in a hotel room or poolside table for folks in the immediate area. Using my player's equalizer to match music proved crucial. Non-detachable audio output cable is extremely short, just barely able to hook up to MP3, etc., that's cozied next to it. You may want to carry a male-female extension cable when it's desirable to keep source and speaker a bit further apart. Price? Unbeatable."
,,George Chang,Great little portable speaker,10 Apr 2012,5.0 ,"I purchased this speaker to use on vacation with my iphone. It's very compact and generates surprisingly good sound for the size. I brought extra sets of batteries, but didn't need them for the week that we were away, playing the speaker for a couple of hours each day. I wasn't expecting much for the price and size, but enjoyed the sound and also that it took up very little space in my bag. It produces fairly crisp sound versus the washed out tones of some small speakers I've owned in the past. Overall, good value and sound given the form factor. If you're expecting this to reproduce the range of a full blown stereo with tower speakers, you need to reset expectations."
,,Jeanne Dennis,Incredible speaker and great value,17 Mar 2010,5.0 ,"I read other reviews before purchasing this, hoping that the problem experienced with the power button would not be too much trouble. I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality and volume of the speaker, which I purchased to use in my exercise class to provide sounds for the gals to hear while moving....worried about the volume a bit, but had to actually turn it down, which was great. I have used this for 3 weeks now, two nights a week and have yet to need a replacement of batteries......very awesome and convenient that it uses the same size as the mp3 player. I would highly recommend this for anyone requiring a speaker for their mp3."
,,Lantana Al,Nice speaker for the size,05 Jan 2011,4.0 ,"Pros: * Size, compactness * ""360 degree"" sound * Includes carrying case * Good quality and volume for the size Cons: * No auto-power-off * No USB power option * No volume control on unit * Says ""distortion-free"" but does distort at louder volumes (though it does say to keep volume on player to 85-90% of maximum) Other: * I was a bit disappointed it uses AAA instead of AA batteries. This decreases the weight but lowers the run-time. * Warranty extends to 2 years if product is registered"
,,Matthew Ebel,Excellent Merch Table Speaker,07 Sep 2013,5.0 ,"I wanted to find something with great sound that would last 8+ hours and be cheap enough that, if it were stolen, I wouldn't cry too much. FOUND IT. When I play shows at conventions, I end up sitting at my dealer table all day trying to sell CD's, shirts, etc. and I needed something to play some of my music. Even in a crowded ballroom, the sound performance of this one little speaker is adequate enough to give newcomers a good first impression of my music. It's lightweight, easy to pack into my merch table box, and will last a full work day (actually several) on three fresh Eneloop AAA's. And for $20, if someone swipes it off the table when I'm hitting the restroom, I'd be disappointed but not screwed. PERFECT!"
,,Sublimeric,"Great speaker, BUT...",13 Jul 2012,4.0 ,"I purchased this speaker in March of 2011, and it performed great until July 2012 when the unit simply refused to turn on and found a new home in my trash can. Not a big deal that it stopped working, especially after 16 months of regular use, and considering I paid about $20 for it. My only complaint about the speaker is that the bottom piece that you remove to access the battery compartment was difficult to operate. It came off easily, but replacing the cover was a regular headache. In addition, the batteries were loose and had to be re-adjusted often otherwise the unit would not operate. Requiring batteries instead of a USB charge was a pain for me, but the 3 AAA's that the speaker used lasted seemingly forever and ever each time. I just wish it was easier to access/replace the battery compartment when the time came to do so. Hopefully this little ""quirk"" has been addressed with the newer model that is available. Overall, GREAT speaker! Great value, too!"
,,Torry,great speaker for the p-sb7,15 Mar 2013,5.0 ,"i use this speaker for the paranormal field for the p-sb7. what is the p-sb7? p-sb7 is a modified radio that scans threw 120 radio stations rapidly and the spirits can talk threw the device, fm band scan rate is 100-350ms and am scan rate is 200-550ms on the p-sb7. so far this speaker is very good and very loud since the internal speaker of the p-sb7 is so low i need to hold it up to my ear to hear for voices and the altec speaker is loud enough that i can use it with a group of people. i would defenly recamend this product. i forgot to mention and show in the video once the p-sb7 starts scanning it loses more then half of its volume."
,,R. Elliott,Good little speaker,14 Feb 2013,4.0 ,"I use this for around-the-house listening with my little generic mp3 player when I don't want to have headphones on (which is most of the time). There isn't anywhere to stick your mp3 player, which is just about the only drawback (I wound up using some squares of self-adhesive ""hook-and-loop"" fasteners on the side of this speaker and the back of the mp3 player and for all of $0.25, it works well). It's not going blow your eardrums out or really impress you with the sound, but on the other hand it's not bad for such a little thing, and I'm very pleased with the energy use (which translates to battery life). I use mine for about 2 or 3 hours every day listening to the news or some music or a podcast, and it seems like it goes for months without needing to recharge the 3 AAAs in there. Definitely worth the money."
,,Edward P. Scott,This little guy is a real eye/ear-opener!,07 Jan 2010,5.0 ,"I had recently purchased a new Vaio laptop which has an amazingly crisp/clear hi-def widescreen display, but kinda weak/tinny audio. I wanted a simple, portable speaker that would upgrade the sound. I was a little skeptical about the one speaker design, but I gave the Orbit a try (maybe because Orbit's also the name of my one-eyed cat). This thing sounds great! Believe me, one really good speaker beats out mediocre stereo speakers any day of the week. I plug it into any and all of my iPods (we have five in our family), any laptop and even my kitchen tv. In every case, the sound is vastly improved. Everyone who's heard it is amazed and I've probably been responsible for selling five more by demontrating the Orbit to friends. I've had it a month and I'm still on the first set of batteries. For it's size and price, you can't beat this little guy."
,,Mrs. Otter,mighty little speaker,19 Jun 2013,5.0 ,"We've had this speaker for years and purchased several more as gifts. It has traveled around the world with us and provided us with music at the beach, by the pool, in the snow, at home, etc. It is the best little speaker we've found. We really do recommend it, but there are two pieces of bad news to report. First, when the batteries die, it is unpleasant. It doesn't die and turn off; it makes loud, unbearable noises (kind of like interference). Just hope you're not far away at that moment. The second thing is that the wiring on the plug went bad on our first speaker. Thankfully, my handy husband was able to switch it out with an old headphone cable. Our family and friends haven't had that problem. Overall, we are big fans of this little speaker."
,,Em,Wonderful little speaker,16 Dec 2013,5.0 ,"We bought this to use on a roadtrip (in-car radio was broken) and we have used it almost daily ever since. It's just plain handy, and produces very good sound. Highly recommend. *update* After nearly five years of almost daily use, the audio wire that attaches to your device is shorting out, but the speaker itself is still performing perfectly. I'd say that was a pretty good run. I'll be buying another."
,,S. Roberts,Great sound from such a small speaker,09 Jan 2012,4.0 ,"For the money, this little speaker is a great value. Feels well made and sound quality is better than expected with good volume and range for its small size and battery power. The cord stores neatly underneath and it is small enough to be packed in a backpack or laptop bag for use while traveling to supplement weak iPod/iPhone or computer speakers. The battery life seems good so far in the two weeks I have been using almost daily. The front power button has a green light, which is helpful in preventing it from being left on and draining the battery. I am taking away one star only because I think it should power off when the cord is unplugged. Several times I have had my iPhone plugged in, received a call, quickly unplugged it to take the call and forgot to turn the power off. Not sure how battery life will hold up if I continue to forget. I would recommend this product and would give as a gift."
,,Kyle Hall,Like a few others here,03 Nov 2014,4.0 ,"After my speaker conked out in just under two years, I was prepared to post a review here complaining about that ... until I saw how little I'd paid for it via Amazon: about $14. What a bargain for a powerful little speaker that did the job for less than $1 per month! (I just ordered its replacement for virtually the same price.) My gripe has become a hearty recommendation. Like a few others here, I think the frequent replacing of the batteries makes the metal receptors in the battery chamber ineffective over time, so I would have preferred a model with an AC cord, but the market must want portability in speakers such as these. As it is, I'll be glad to replace them every two years or so if the sound quality and convenience continue to be this good."
,,Loo,Not bad,28 May 2011,3.0 ,"I owned a great little portable stereo player that I purchased for ten bucks but alas it was lost. I searched stores everywhere for a replacement but nothing lived up to my standards. I turned to Amazon because things were rated by customers. I purchased two potable speakers: the altec lansing and iLuv isp 100. I was ripped off by the iLuv. I have a separate review for that item. This not a bad speaker. It is not stereo (since it is only one speaker) but sadly, there is no way to link two of them together for a stereo sound. The sound itself on the iPhone is great at lower levels. But once you get past the halfway mark on the phone it becomes tinny and distorted. A bit problematic in a noisy car or in a larger room. The sound is better than the one on the phone and my laptop so I use it often. One big plus is the straight plug that fits into my first generation iPhone and am generally happy with this item. I just miss my other cheapy stereo speakers that only cost me ten bucks from some chain store."
,,David R. Rishel,"Very tinny sound, zipper case turns item on!",15 Jan 2010,2.0 ,"Maybe it's me...but I bought this with modest expectations and it is just not a very good speaker. The sound seems to have very little range on the low end. The high end is pretty good and can even be crisp, but I don't want to listen to just treble. This gets worse at higher volume, with the sound more or less screaming. Even with percussion, you hear impact of a snare drum without the depth of the drum sound. I could live with these shortcomings--after all this is not an expensive item--but the power button is a problem. As other folks have said, the button protrudes and it's a spring loaded on/off button. The thing is, if you put the speaker in the protective zip case to take with you when you travel, the fabric seam on the case pushes against the button and turns the unit on! The case fits very tightly and there is no way to avoid this. If you want to carry the speaker in the case, you must remove the batteries, to say nothing about how the case pressing so firmly on the power button will affect the functionality of the button over time. Sadly, I returned the item. P.S. I like Altec Lansing stuff in general very much...keep trying guys."
,,MOAG757,Good Smartphone Companion,04 Dec 2011,4.0 ,"I was shopping for something inexpensive with a decent sound quality to connect to my blackberry whenever I want a soundtrack to set the mood for what ever i'm doing, photography, painting, working, vacation etc... I also wanted to purchase a reputable brand for sound quality. Not only did I get what I want but I was pleased with the volume and sound quality from such a small source. The quality of the housing, 3.5mm jack, and battery cover doesn't seem very durable so I will make sure I take care of it. The device requires 3 AAA batteries which is an odd configuration considering the housing seems like it could hold 4 AA batteries. If you want a fuller sound from your smart phone on the go this is a good item to spend twenty eight bucks on. Ordering from Amazon has been a great experience and reading the reviews on this product helped me make this purchase as well as the price point."
,,T. Nguyen,sound was awful,03 Jan 2013,1.0 ,"This was the first product I ordered from Amazon that came out awful. I've had an Altec Lansing speaker from the past, but it got stolen, so we were looking for a replacement one and ordered this one. Out of the box it sounded like it was already busted. At highest volume the audio was hollow and quiet. I'm sure it was a defective one and the rest might be fine, but I just did a full return, didn't want to deal with an exchange for another one of questionable quality."
,,Ed Erdman,Craptastic,07 Nov 2015,1.0 ,"This Chinese made piece of garbage gave me I would estimate probably 20 minutes or so or half an hour tops, of usage over the 3 years I've had it, before it crapped out and no longer works. That's more than the 10 minutes I'd expect from a Chinese made piece of junk, so for that it earns one star! How do they sell this crap for 50 bucks a pop they could make them to last in the USA for that price. Vastly overpriced. On the plus side it got significant volume when it worked, but that simply isn't for very long."
,,Happy2BeMe,Wow! This made my iPad 1 sound amazing!,07 May 2012,5.0 ,"This little speaker is great. I have only one con - the little cord that connects it to the iPad 1 is REALLY short! Seriously, it is very, very short, so the speaker has to be able to stay close to the iPad during play. Oh well... The sound if fantastic. It really makes the little iPad 1 speaker sound get BIG! You unwind the short cord from the bottom of this speaker (neatly housed on the bottom), and then connect it to the earphone hole on the iPad. That's it. The sound instantly booms out! There hasn't been any distortion yet. I sure hope this lasts awhile. The speaker works off a few AAA batteries, and as long as you remember to turn it off after you are done with it, it seems to last through several movies at least. Definitely worth the money."
,,Larry,Very nice little speaker. Met expectations.,29 Sep 2011,4.0 ,"After using this little speaker for 3 weeks, I really like it. I use it mostly for podcasts and audiobooks, but the sound quality is good enough for an enjoyable experience with most of the music I listen to. The form factor is perfect for carrying around the house with my old iPod. So far, I am impressed with the battery life. I am using rechargeable AAA's, and have not had to recharge yet after @ 10 hours of use. My only criticism is for the little cable that connects the speaker to whatever audio source you are using. It seems a bit on the flimsy side to me."
,,CF,"Ree-DICULOUSLY Cool Little Speaker, Sheeesh!",06 Jan 2011,5.0 ,"EDITED 2 DAYS LATER to add: Cool enhancements follow the product review part ;-)** Arg! Edited over a week later because my unit glitched. Please see notes on that AFTER this review because I think it's just a defect with my particular copy of this unit. I actually bought this for audiobook listening without earphones, so I could take it from room to room easily, and not have to shlep my bigger speaker. I did not expect much from it in terms of sound, but wowza! I'm just totally amazed at the sound that comes out of this little thing! It's 3-3/8"" across and 2"" tall which is bigger than its other two competitors, but as another VERY comprehensive reviewer wrote, comparison video and all, the added size pays for itself hands down in sound quality. Is it going to replace your Bose? Nope. But if you want something downright impressive in terms of sound for size, and to boot with a lanyard and carabiner clip that you can secure through a belt loop as you truck around the house or yard without rubber jammed into your ears, it's a whole lotta bang for the buck. As for music... Crystal Bowersox at high Ipod volume -- outstanding sound. You can hear all background and with some definite depth, and her voice comes through crystal clear. Celtic instrumentals are terrific (cello, violin, mandolin). Percussion comes through quite crisp and impressively, though doesn't have the stomach-thump, obviously, but I'm sure you knew that. Voices come through nothing short of outstandingly. I'm truly kind of blown away by this thing. I'm not suggesting anything disloyal to fellow consumers, but if A.L. advertised it as ""phenomenal sound in a tiny package that you can wear"" and doubled its price, I'm betting this little thing would be seen walking up and down the beach, lol. Battery only (three AAA) with no AC cord, it has an on/off switch with no volume control so plan on turning on your ipod just to change volume, but that's not a biggie. The earjack cord is short, only 8"" door to door which at first dismayed me, but it's actually an advantage if wearing the thing with iPod clipped to your pocket. The cord stows in a workable wind-around with a recessed housing for the earjack plug. Upscale looking unit (dull 2-tone silver) that's not plasticky looking at all, good build overall with a sturdy protective screen over the speaker itself, and its case is a very nice quality in a semi-stiff shape-molded material that will have definite protective value to it, and not any bigger than it has to be to house the unit. The case has a tab with a grommet so it could hang off something also. I'd call this one a real winner! ETA: Okay, 2 things. One is, I wanted to see if I could get a little more depth yet, out of this little speaker. Experiment around in your pots and pans cupboard. I have a Farberware metal mixing bowl, and just for the fun of it I stuck the speaker into that. It amplifies. I wanted a little less treble side effect, and added a dish towel. Move things around and try different containers. You may get a whole lot more out of this little speaker yet. Second thing: The one thing I didn't like about this speaker is no on/off/pause switch without having to turn on my iPod, hit the unlock slider, yadda yadda. More than laziness, if the phone rings or I need an instant pause and don't want to take the time for that, I missed that feature. Well, it dawned on me, I bought a Belkin headphone adapter/controller which I use with my non-apple headphones which gives you volume, fast forward/rewind, next song, previous song and pause. I attached that between my iPod and this speaker, and there's zero compromise in sound. So now anything this little speaker did lack for me is there. All except that it's not a dock that charges, but I ain't even goin' there, lol. However, I must say the reviews on that Belkin are not stellar. People complain that it stops working. Well, I have two of them, and they've been wrapped around my iPod, stashed in and out of my glove compartment, poked, prodded, etc. and for several months. Neither shows any sign of failing in any way. EDIT: My copy of this unit glitched. A week or so after writing this review, I was listening to music in the background, and suddenly I heard a loud hum. Next thing... it sounded like Alvin & the Chipmunks were having a loud spat. I turned it off, then a day later tried it again. Same thing happened after a while (I suspect after it warms up). I'm going to return my copy but I have a feeling it's not all these units, but that I might have just gotten a defective one. Just sayin'."
,,Don Lowe,Impressed,22 Dec 2011,5.0 ,"I saw this Altec Lansing and wanted it, but it was almost $30.00 So I bought one of the expandable speakers for less money, that worked Great. Really does. Then the Altec is on sale for $15.00? Couldn't pass it up. Using it with my Android phone. Sounds great, Loud, Clear, impressive. Even sounds better when I run it thru my $5.00 ""Fiio"" headphone amplifier. The amp has a Bass button, plus volumn control, so you can tune it like you like. This speaker alone does not have much bass. And its larger than it looks, read the dimensions. But I would highly recommend it to friends. Should come with a case that is available for $4.99. If you can get it on sale like I did , its a Great deal. Someone commented on the IMT227, this unit is no longer available from Altec Lansing, I called yesterday. It is the exact same speaker."
,,Dar,"Nice speaker, bad cord.",03 Jun 2010,3.0 ,"Call this a eulogy for my Altec Lansing Orbit speaker. For the first several months after I purchased it, everything went well. Then one day I discovered that the patch cord on the unit had become damaged and was making an intermittent connection. Although the speaker itself is mono, it seemed as if one of the stereo channels was being lost, resulting in sudden volume reductions and sound drop-outs. Jiggling the cord around where it attached to the plug would fix it for a while, but eventually it would slip out of the correct position again. This is probably due to the design of the plug retainer on the bottom side of the speaker--it's molded to fit the plug and a short portion of the cord, but it also pinches the cord right at the point where it connects to the plug. That said, I enjoyed it while I had it; it had excellent sound for a speaker its size and solid battery life. I mainly used it to listen to podcasts and music during my lunch break and under those occasional-use conditions it would go weeks between battery changes. (I used AAA Eneloop batteries .) I would recommend it to anyone who's in the market for a portable mono speaker--just be careful with the cord."
,,P. C. Razon,Great portable speakers!,04 Dec 2012,4.0 ,"This is a great speaker! I just got this today and played with it the whole day about 8hrs. Everything works great even playing with EDMs on my iPod. I used this outside the office for a while and it definitely hits the beat. You can hear the kick drum when playing EDMs, and it does not sound like its sound came from a tin can. I would definitely recommend this product to my friends. PROs: * It is very loud as for the size of the speaker. * It has its own strap that you can hold with it or tie it with your bag. * It has click-button power switch. That way you will know you pressed the power button. And there is also a LED light so that you will be aware that it was turned on. CONs: * No LINE-IN jack. There is no way you can chain-connect another device with this unit. (I had to remove 1-star because of this.) * No carrying case. As expected for a $20 unit. * No rubber grip on the side of the speaker. You can hold them with one hand but it would be better if there is a rubbery side of the speaker that when you hold it you feel that you had a good grip on the speaker. (I guess thats where the strap came along.)"
,,Munchiniwa,Amazing for its size,23 Nov 2014,5.0 ,These little speakers are amazing. I take them to conferences for computer output -- they fill a typical conference room fine and take up almost no space. My daughter always takes them to the beach and I have a hard time getting it back. Check out a YouTube comparison of the different brands -- i thought this one was best and have been very pleased.
,,Pookie#1,exactly as expected...as described...,28 Dec 2011,4.0 ,"I am very happy with this little speaker because it packs a audio punch for it's size!.... Perfect for portable devises, PC, portable DVD players .....Also, for example, when listening to Pandora on my computer, I had to turn down both Pandora volume and my computer volume because there was so much bass in the Orbit, it would have caused the music to sound distorted. With all that considered, still had plenty of volume! I luv that I can just drop my very lightweight Orbit in my purse and go.....wish it came with a AC cord or travel charger but my litheum battery's are lasting a long time....a great price too!"
,,WhiteLily928,Nice speaker for MP3 player,22 Nov 2011,5.0 ,"I bought this for my MP3 player to listen to my music while in the shower and getting ready for work. I am amazed at the volume it produces. I'm not an expert on sound quality, but it sounds okay to me and it is loud enough for me to hear my music over the shower and the hair dryer. It also tested well playing music from my cell phone. The cord is short and wraps around the bottom for easy storage. Not an issue for my MP3 player, but it would be an issue if I used my cell phone for music and wanted to use other apps at the same time. It comes with a wrist strap which I use when transporting the speaker from room to room. At first, the volume wasn't great from MP3 player, but I adjusted the settings on my MP3 player and it resolved the problem. This works for me because I use rechargeable batteries. If you don't have rechargeable AAA batteries, you may not like this speaker due to replacing batteries. I've been using it daily for a week, a few hours in the morning and for a couple days a few hours at night. So far, batteries are holding. I use Eneloop batteries."
,,Myles Fenix,"Holy FAST shipping, Batman!!",12 Oct 2011,4.0 ,"I bought this speaker on Monday October 10th at 1:00 am. I received it Tuesday October 11th at 9:00 am!! Very cool! I was super excited to receive this little speaker. I got this item for the sole reason to use on my iPad since the built-in speaker on that device is horribly low, even in quiet rooms! I plugged this baby in my iPod and had 5 people in the living room speak at the same time to see if this thing can overpower that noise. Man was I surprised! This thing drowned all five people out! My brother and I were equally shocked at how loud this thing really is. After my first test run with it, my brother took my smartphone, logged into my Amazon account, and bought one for himself. Yes he asked first lol. I am planning on posting a video to show how loud this thing is. I deducted a star because, when I put my iPod and iPad on full volume, the speaker's bass began to completely ruin the sound. It sounded like an busted up speaker and the lyrics were muffled. That kind of annoyed me...a lot. But to remedy this, all I did was set my iPod and iPad to either Treble reducer or Bass Reducer. The sound became instantly clear again. I do wish I could enjoy lots of bass without the sound losing quality, but the sheer volume of this thing makes up for that!"
,,Vance B.,"Just ""OK""; I'm surprised at the high rating",10 Oct 2011,3.0 ,"This portable speaker is pretty handy, and perhaps there are no better options out there. It basically does the job, for what I intended it for--which is listening to audio books and music on my MP3 player, without headphones. I use it outside, or when I'm in the bathroom, getting ready for work--any time I don't want to use headphones. Here are the reasons I give it only 3 stars: 1) The cord that plugs into your electronic device is only about 6 inches long! That seems a little ridiculous to me. I guess you don't have to worry about the cord getting tangled up in anything! 2) The power button is recessed, which makes it a little difficult to shut the thing on and off, unless your fingers are pointy like a pencil tip. My fingers are not exactly fat, and I still have trouble with it (press hard). You won't have to worry about accidently breaking the power button off. 3) The volume output is OK, but could be better. Some of the audio books I listen to I can hear while in the shower, some I can't. It depends on the loudness of the narrator's voice, and perhaps the volume level of the book recordings. Sometimes I wish it were louder, is all I'm saying. On the positive side, it seems to be pretty well-made, and batteries seem to last well. I'm using rechargeable batteries. I believe I'm on my 4th audio book, and have only had to swap the batteries one time. And that was with me forgetting to power it off a couple of times."
,,Amazon Customer,Very loud for such a little speaker,24 Jan 2012,5.0 ,"Finding a speaker to project sound from my smartphone was like looking for a needle in a haystack on Amazon. There was another highly rated speaker on Amazon but some of the reviewers were skeptical about the authenticity of those reviews. I'm not sure how so many could be fake, but what did it for me is there was a video review for the other one and I wasn't impressed with the sound. I found a video review for this one and there was a noticeable before and after difference in loudness. So I took the leap, figured $20-ish was worth the risk and I was so happy with the results (both the loudness and clarity) that I bought a 2nd one for my 16-yr-old son, who requested one for Christmas after he borrowed mine for his smartphone. The only slight drawback is it's battery powered and I wish it could derive power from the phone or whatever I plug it into. The power button is pretty small and inconspicuous so I sometimes forget to turn it off. But for $20 and how it sounds, it's worth those slight drawbacks."
,,Jon,Good all around product,11 Aug 2011,5.0 ,"I've owned and demo'ed dozens of portable speakers, and this is probably my favorite in terms of form and function. You can definitely pay more money and get a speaker that has more range (and I have), but in the world of pocket-sized portable speakers, you can only go so far anyway. I think the beauty of the Orbit is its relative simplicity. It has a single, mono speaker, which is actually about twice as big as most other competitors of similar devices. Which means it doesn't try to cram tweeters and a bass port in a small space, or two separate speakers for stereo, multiple drivers, etc. As a result, this speaker is very efficient and can put out quite a bit of midrange volume (and still have decent bass and highs) for a long time on a set of batteries. This is key for me because I hate having to worry about keeping another device charged and an internal battery that goes dead over time. With the Orbit, I can go weeks without having to change the batteries, and I use it several times a week. And when it does run down, it's easy to come by a set of AAA batteries and pop them in and good to go again. I also really like the carrying case. I'm not afraid to bring this with me wherever I go and it's not something I worry about if I accidentally drop it. The speaker is round and there's not really anything to break on it if you do drop it. I had an $80 speaker once that had a fold out type design and a friend knocked it off a table and broke it. Not worried about the Orbit. As far as the sound goes, it's got a lot of volume potential as long as you don't kill it with bass. It will distort with heavy bass, but it does a great job with the midrange, which is pretty much where most of your vocals are going to be and the main thing you want really out of a small speaker. I use this most out on the golf course. It fits perfect in a cup holder on the golf cart and I play it about 1/4 volume or so and it sounds clear and fantastic. I also throw it in with my luggage every time I go on a trip and it travels well. I also use it with my iPad and my Macbook Air (looks great paired with the MBA). The only thing I do wish is that they made a Bluetooth version. But overall, I think it does exactly what I need it to do very well, and at $30, it's hard to go wrong. This is the best value out there in my opinion. Would definitely buy again in a heartbeat."
,,Amazon Customer,Item works fine after 14 months,28 Oct 2011,5.0 ,"I prefer to wait at least six months or longer before posting a review of electronic items. I bought this Altec speaker on July 10, 2010 and it worked fine for about a year. It was convenient and comfortable to use on my laptop at night while watching movies in my bedroom. The sound was what you'd expect from such a device, superbly functional, but limited to mono. I hadn't used it for several months. Earlier today, I connected it to my kindle (audio book) and the screeching/static noise described in several previous one-star reviews had now infected my device. I paid about 26 dollars for it during a gold-box sale, and it was fine for awhile. The LED was illuminated RED. I just changed the batteries and it's working fine again. I would recommend this to everyone, just make sure to change the batteries if the LED is RED. The device now works as well as when I first purchased it. Although it's relatively inexpensive and convenient to use, I recommend waiting till it's a gold-box special before purchasing."
,,Kam,Great sound in a tiny package,30 Dec 2009,5.0 ,"The IM-237 Orbit speakers provides very good sound with a wide dynamic range - from a tiny speaker in a package about the size of an orange. Great for presentations - you don't have to lug big speakers with you - or listening on an ipod. Far bigger, deeper sound than the built in speakers in my 17"" Macbook pro. If you are expecting this little device to sound like your home stereo system you'll be disappointed. But the compromise of small size, portability, low price and very acceptable sound makes the iM-237 Orbit well worth it. Battery life is OK. The cord wraps nicely around the base and the mini-plug stores into a recessed area on the base. However, at only 6"" long, it is maddeningly short. Minor flaws aside, this is a very good product at a reasonable price."
,,Midwest Guy,Very Good For What It Is,31 Jan 2010,5.0 ,"***Update*** 03/18/2012 - After having this product for a couple of years, I must add that the cable does fail after some time. It is not durable and will not last. Given that this was inexpensive it was not a huge deal. But I see the current price is much higher now which makes this a poor purchase. There are new models of the speaker and if you can spend a couple of Jackson's on it, the value is still there. Just be extra careful with the cable. -------------------------------------- I purchased two of these for Christmas 2009. One each for my two kids. They love the little speaker and they use it all the time with their iPods. I've used it on my laptop and it sound just fine there too. I think the sound quality is great for what it is (a cheap little monaural speaker) and the battery life is very good. The carrying case is well designed and a nice accessory to have. My only complaint is the little wire the plugs into the iPod is fairly thin and seems like it won't hold up well. Only time will tell. If this thing breaks, I promise to come back here and update my review with the bad news. If there are no updates then you can assume the speaker is still working fine. Altec Lansing, if you ever read these reviews, here's an idea. I'd upgrade this speaker to have an out jack and a switch at the bottom. Then if someone bought two of these, they could take the second speaker and plug the cable into the first speaker's out jack. The first speaker would preferably recognize it is being used in stereo mode automatically and only play the left channel with the other speaker playing only the right channel. If this can't be done automatically, then a three way little switch on the bottom could be set for left-both-right settings. This would make these really awesome. Buy one to use for general purposes or buy a second one and they could be used individually or together in stereo mode. This is just a wish list item. As is, this little speaker was just the ticket for the family."
,,bonesonpoint,Use it all the time with iPhone and computer,11 Feb 2010,5.0 ,"I bought this because it came to my mailbox from someone one day, maybe Apple Store, for $19.95. I figured if it made any noise at all it might be useful for my purposes where earbuds get in my way and I want to listen to the music or talk radio on my iPhone. You just plug it into the earbud jack, turn the speaker on and you've got sound. It will generate a lot of volume and for the size it sounds surprisingly good. It's not a Bose Wave, but it sounds a lot better than I expected and it is 360 degree sound. If you can set it in a little enclosure like on a shelf in the corner or some box shaped area it will enhance the bass and music sounds pretty good on it. Voice is very clear. I work with my hands so I like to use this instead of having the wires from the earbuds constantly getting tangled up in what I am doing. I also use it on my computer for sound. I have a high end, high definition sound computer and this sounds much, much better. If I have one complaint it is that the wire is too short. A longer wire would have been nice, however, this short wire does wrap around the back of the speaker and store there, along with the jack so that's a good feature. It takes three triple A batteries and if you don't forget to turn it off each time they will last a good while. They power the speaker and boost the signal coming from the sound source. I can also take it in the car and set it on the dash to hear things I can't get on my car radio but can get on the iPhone streaming through the internet. I tried to buy more of these after I got mine to keep around and give away for presents but I can't find them that cheap. Still, I see them for under $30.00 and it is definitely worth that. I use mine all the time. One last thing, although this works great for me with my computer and iPhone, for some reason I can't get my wife's iPod to kick it. Not sure why. Great for iPhone though. It will play louder than you want to hear it."
,,S. Jones,Nice Little Portable Speaker,28 Dec 2014,5.0 ,"I love this little speaker. I listen to music on it sometimes but mostly use it to listen to Audiobooks while I'm cooking or working around the house. I love being able to plug in my iPod, turn it on, and start listening. There is definite noise distortion when you crank it up to full volume, but for an economical little portable speaker, it's a bargain and it does a great job."
,,Mark Andrew,great low-cost sound,07 Aug 2011,5.0 ,"I compared the Altec Orbit iM227 with a Brookstone and a Phillips battery-powered mP3 player speaker, all three purchased for about $20. All three lasted 24 - 48 hours on one charge, although the Brookstone used 2 AA batteries and the other two used three AAAs. Since my mP3 uses AAA, having the speaker use AAA as well is a better fit. The Orbit sound quality was clearly the best, with a full midrange, clear nondistorted high range and much better bass response. The Brookstone sounded muffled and the Phillips had almost no bass and a very tinny high range. In addition to its excellent sound quality, the Orbit cord was just the right length, the directionality was excellent, the unit was stable and there was no need for a volume control since my MP3 had one. The pushbutton power switch worked well and the LED light is a good indicator to save battery power, but the suggestion to store it without batteries is probably a good one to guard against accidental button depression. I've got no need for a case and the included lanyard should have been omitted as well. I found the Orbit ideal as a travel speaker with perfect volume for a hotel room and plenty loud for ""sleep mode"" at night with my MP3 set to only 1/3 volume."
,,DB from NC,Sweet little hockey puck,25 Dec 2011,5.0 ,"Bought this for this wife based on the reviews and surprise, the reviewers were right on. Really nice sound for what it is (a sub-$20 speaker). Pros: *Spatial sound for a non-stereo unit *Nice form factor *Use of standard AAA batteries *Has plenty of volume, but don't expect it to be LOUD Cons: *No longer comes with a case *Short audio cord My mom heard it on Christmas morning and made me order her one too."
,,RedTalon19,Fantastic little speaker,21 Sep 2013,5.0 ,"For its size and price, the volume and quality of sound this little thing makes is astounding. Sure it has limited frequency response obviously in the lower ranges, but it extends lower than I expected. The mid range can sometimes be overbearing, particularity with snare drum hits for example but otherwise its decently balanced. Again, for the price, size and portability this thing is fantastic.; highly recommended. As a bonus, it comes with brand name batteries for immediate use."
,,C. Dougherty,Such great sound for such a small little cylinder!,30 Nov 2011,4.0 ,"I spent around 14 dollars for this cute little speaker. Its not top quality sound, but for the price its almost like it is. I use this speaker with my computer when I watch TV shows and movies online, and when I'm cooking or cleaning around the house. I wish the cord was a bit longer, but I like how you can easily wind it around the bottom for easy storage. The speaker doesn't feel cheap and is a good weight. I recommend this to anyone who wants a boost in sound for small electronics."
,,Jason C.,Terrific,02 Jan 2013,5.0 ,"This is the perfect desk speaker for work, a perfect speaker to add to your laptop for an extra kick of sound. The sound is controled by your device. The speaker only has on on/off button. It offers full range of bass & treble. If you want a spectral analysis then this is not your speaker. It's small & sounds good. Let's not get more complicated than that. It also fills a small room with pleasant sound when you want background music and NOT a dance party. This speaker served us well when we moved into a new place and had no stereo equipment hooked up. iPods and laptops played off this for a few days and we only changed the batteries once. For now it remains on my desk at work and gets used daily. I end up changing batteries 1X week. Highly recommended."
,,Malcoln_Rodgers,"sounds fantastic, small, portable, perfect",16 Aug 2009,5.0 ,"yeah, my home stereo is mcintosh, so i know what the music is supposed to sound like, and this thing more than holds it's own for the price. it's great that it's just one and not two speakers (easy to carry), also, it get's the little ambient sound and subtleties. the ""eq"" is better than on my car stereo, as the sound is very balanced across the spectrum. everyone raves. a friend had it, and i had to get it. if you're thinking about it, and wondering, i'm saying, get it. perfect for on the road, at work, outdoors, etc."
,,D_Spider,"Pretty Sturdy, Too.",19 Dec 2013,5.0 ,"I was really scared right after I dropped it, but that was two years ago, and this speaker still works fine and still sounds great (admittedly, I use it for audiobooks, but considering its handiness and size and cost, it sounds great). I use it when I'm static and don't want or need earbuds connecting me to my MP3 player. I use it connected to my laptop when I want more volume and better sound (I get both). I use rechargeable batteries in it, and they last for days of almost constant use. This speaker is everything it's supposed to be."
,,Joe,Good sound but ridiculously thin wire,08 Jan 2015,4.0 ,"Good sound for such a small speaker. Great value for the price. Loud enough. As others have said, the short 9-inch wire is ridiculously thin and will eventually break. I will have to take it apart and solder a thicker wire to this speaker. Shame on the manufacturer for not spending another 10 cents to put a thicker wire on these speakers. Don't expect any bass out of a speaker this small. If you do, you don't understand physics."
,,Holly M. Pergande,"Perfect little speaker, doesn't get any better for this style of product.",17 Nov 2010,5.0 ,"I purchased this speaker as kind of spur of the moment kind of buy because I wanted a decent quality portable speaker. That is EXACTLY what I received. My friends and I all agree that this thing puts out an amazing amount of sound for its size and it is all crystal clear. The bass is there as well as the treble. I listen to primarily techno music and that tends to cover the entire spectrum of sounds fairly well. Treble is clear and on key. Bass is clear as well, but certainly don't expect to ""feel"" it, that's not the point of this kind of speaker anyway. As far as loudness the speaker pumps! If you turn it up, you should have no problem hearing it at every corner of your house. Its supremely simple to use and very portable, it comes with carry case and carabiner for goodness sake! Ha Anyway, if you want a very clear, very portable and very loud little speaker to go with you somewhere where you don't have a full fledge stereo at hand this is perfect. Only con I have with it is that it uses AAA batteries. They do last for a very long time granted, I've been using this thing almost constantly for over a week now and the stock batteries still run perfect. But I was expecting USB rechargable."
,,R. Spencer,Great speaker!,12 Apr 2013,2.0 ,"NEW UPDAte, BOUGHT 3 of these, 1 fell off my chair onto a carpeted floor, it had permanent screeching sound, now worthless, the 2nd one, just developed this issue on it's own, so far the 3rd one is ok, but I will never buy another one, I got an Oontz Angle and at near or less than the price of this one, you got 10x the speaker. don't buy this one, you could get the screeching sound and it's ruined. We bought this to use with our Spirit Box for Ghost Hunting, the sound is awesome, Altec Lansing was my 1st pick 20 years ago for PC Speakers & although they dropped a bit out of that, they still make awesome speakers & this is one of them, great for Mp3 Players & a Spirit Box, we have this one & the Ihome version, & both are great for Music, SPirit Box & anything you want to play through them, either brand is good, excellent quality for a tiny speaker when playing music."
,,James McFrogger,Almost perfect.,24 Apr 2010,4.0 ,"Take this as a 4.5 stars review. I did a lot of research to buy a small portable speaker, i was looking for good sound first, portability second, and a decent playtime on third. ""cnet"" is a good site to get reviews, most of them with videos trying out the products, it was there when i made up my mind. According to cnet the iM237 has better sound quality than my other options, the X-Mini II Capsule Speaker the Altec Lansing iM207 Orbit-MP3 for iPod and MP3 Players and the iHome iHM77 Rechargeable Mini Speakers for iPod (Black) , they all claim to be ""for iPod"" but they do this for the technologically impaired people. all of them have standard 3.5 stereo jack, I'm using mine mostly with a netbook and a Zune. I have use the iHome iHM77 Rechargeable Mini Speakers for iPod (Black) , my father own a set of these. and even he agrees that the iM237 have a better, louder sound and more bass, which is really good considering the size and the usual bass from portable speakers, he was very impressed at this little powerful silver thingy. plus it looks really fancy, and the case is useful. They run on batteries, which is both, a pro and a con, PRO: built in batteries deplete, might take long, 2 or 3 years but when they do the device is rather useless if they cant be replaced. CON: well, is much easier and cheaper to charge than to buy batteries every time they run off energy. the good thing about the iM237 is that the battery life is really high, been using mine for over a week, about 2 hours a day and still haven't seen the red light ( yeah, the led indicates the state of the batteries, if turned on, green when OK, red when you need to change them) The only flaw is the cord, is way to short, i hate when one small flaw separate perfection from just very good. and it does has space enough to store some more inches of cable, the double or triple of length would be more decent, but as it is, man it really sucks. worst thing is, it doesn't seem that strong as to resist all the pulling and even a ""hang from the jack"" as already happened to me twice, when i rise my laptop or when i move my player. Overall, a very good product, good looking, very good volume, good bass (I dont think you can get more bass at this size/price), and last but not least, highly portable. hope this review was helpful enough for you impaired costumers."
,,W. P. Lee,Much better than I expected,19 Feb 2010,5.0 ,Sound quality was surprisingly good; much better than I expected. Battery life was at least 20 hours using rechargeable Duracell batteries. Padded carrying case included. Replacing the battery-compartment cover involves some fumbling until you get it figured out; be patient. One Altec speaker vs. a stereo docking station: you get one pretty good speaker instead of two pretty crummy speakers that have no real stereo-separation since they're only a few inches apart. I doubt you can do better for under $30.
,,Jack Kimball,Sound excellent! Connector design poor. Easily broken.,05 Feb 2012,3.0 ,"I use this with my iPod to listen to podcasts. The sound is amazing for it's size! I could recommend only if you keep is stationary near the device and don't carry them both around a lot as I did. The connector plug becomes twisted and the cord frayed, eventually breaking - for me, within about 2 months of use. I found another portable speaker that is much lighter but with a much cheaper and more durably designed plug and cord: Philips SBA1600/37 MP3 Portable Speaker SBA1600 Universal (White) The sound for the Phillips is acceptable for voice/podcasts but nothing like the quality of the Altec. If Altec would adopt the Phillips cord/plug design, that would be an awesome product!"
,,geoffrey,if you want a good little speaker with a really short connecting wire and ...,22 Sep 2014,3.0 ,"I bought this little speaker over two years ago to use mostly for my laptop. The pros are, it's loud and clear which made listening to music enjoyable. The cons being that the wire that connects it to whatever you use it with is WAY to short. The wire also isn't very durable ( I ended up pinching it which exposed wires that I wrapped in electrical tape). Also, it actually stopped working last week. So, if you want a good little speaker with a really short connecting wire and a lifespan of approximately 2 1/2 years go for it."
,,Klipspringer,Well worth the $,17 Apr 2010,4.0 ,"Finding the ultimate portable speaker is a constant obsession of mine (I have a boxful of speakers accumulated over the years as proof). The Altec Lansing inMotion series are in my experience the best on the market, but when I saw the iM237 I had to give it a try. It meets my criteria in every regard: the smallest, most portable speaker available with acceptable, even surprising, sound quality. Yes, the cord is short, easily remedied with an inexpensive extension, if for some reason you need the extra length. But, more cord is just more to carry, reducing the portability. Sound quality is quite good for such a tiny device. The lack of stereo sound other reviewers have mentioned is not an issue to me. You're getting ultimate portability, music anywhere you wish to go, and pretty darn good sound in a device that costs less than $30 and takes up half the space of a soda can. That's hard to beat. You do need to be careful when placing the unit in its case that you don't activate the on/off switch, but that is not a major issue. All in all, a very clever, well-designed and highly portable little device, for a ridiculously low price. If maximum portability is your goal, the iM237 will achieve that for you."
,,DJ Strouse,"Long-lasting, beautiful sound, great for home or travel",26 Oct 2012,5.0 ,"I've owned this for a year and a half now and can't be more pleased with it. I bought it for travel but ended up using it as my primary speaker for my laptop since it was so great. Every time I offer this little guy for friends at a party who want to play music or watch a movie, the same sequence of events occurs: skeptically raised eyebrows and hesitant acceptance of my offer followed by wide eyes and dropped jaws at the surprisingly loud and crisp sound. I would love to compare with other compact speakers but this is my first and shows no sign of slowing down so I may never get to!"
,,S Kilson,Great little portable speaker,20 Oct 2013,4.0 ,"The sound from this little speaker is really surprising. The battery life is really very good. I get hours of playing time with the 2 AAA batteries it requires, and the little light turns red when the batteries are getting low. I have had the batteries quit on me at inopportune times, but I always carry spares. Because of this, I wish it had an AC adapter, but for the price, that's okay."
,,Joeb,best portable speaker!!,20 Feb 2013,5.0 ,"i came across this speaker when i was looking for a speaker that can deliver a good sounds. The reviews i read from people about this product was rated high so i decided to purchased one just to see the product can really deliver as stated per people reviews. after giving it a test, this unit had surprised me. yes it did delivered awesome sounds and clarity. i plan to buy two more, one for a gift and the other is for my spare. update: battery life last pretty long which is prefect for me. just assure you have a spare batteries aside and don't have to worry recharging it like other models."
,,T. Bleakney,"Good sound, not Stereo",11 Mar 2010,4.0 ,"This is a quality product that lives up to the Altec Lansing name, which has been associated with premium speakers for decades. Of course physics imparts limits to the quality of sound that can be delivered from a very small speaker, especially at the low end, but the iM237 pushes those limits very hard, much better than other ultra-portable speakers. It is not a boom-box, but the sound is quite impressive. I have seen it used effectively in a small lecture hall to play bird sound from an ipod. This unit uses a stereo cable, but by itself it is not stereo, despite the marketing term ""360 degree"" sound. It plays the sum of the left and right channels. The designers wisely opted to do monophonic well rather than stereo poorly. I bought two so I could have full stereo. It takes a couple of extra connectors to split out the stereo signal into two separate cables, one for the left and one for the right channels. I found the connectors at CablesToGo. Music played with this arrangement is of course not Home Theater quality, but it sounds fine with my iPod Touch. The unit itself, outside its packaging, is lighter than Amazon describes, perhaps 4 oz or so, with its 3 AAA batteries. You can save a little more weight by using Lithium batteries. They cost twice as much, but they last about 4 times as long."
,,David K. Miller,Works with Tascam TR07 recorder,11 Feb 2011,5.0 ,"I agree with other reviews that speak to the good sound quality, small size, low price and included protective case. I'd like to add that the iM237 works very well as an outboard speaker for portable digital recorders that do not have a built-in speaker. I plug the speaker into the headphone/line out jack of my Tascam TR07 and can review rehearsal recordings with other musicians. The speaker volume and frequency range are quite adequate for several people to clearly hear the music."
,,Sphinx,Customer Service Left Wanting For An Unrealible Product,21 Mar 2011,1.0 ,"Like everyone else, I read the reviews and purchased accordingly. Product worked great the first 3 months and then the AUX jack required a great deal of man-handling to be able to hear any mp3. I called Altec's Customer Service and they were extremely uncooperative (they would not validate an Amazon e-receipt as a genuine receipt). I gave up after several tries and contacted Amazon to see if they could intercede on my behalf and convince Altec to stand behind the warranty. Amazon went one step further and just refunded me the money! No wonder I spend 80% of my discretionary spending at Amazon!"
,,Alex C,Great Speaker,28 Feb 2012,5.0 ,"This is an awesome little speaker which, in spite of its small size, can be very loud if turned up. I like the fact that it uses batterries I can swap out quickly, rather than a rechargeable battery (you never know how much time you have left). My only complaint, and it's a small one, is that the built-in cable is quite short. This can be remedied with a 3 or 4 dollar extension cord, but I thought I would mention it. 5 well deserved stars."
,,Crownbach,portable speaker for mobile devices,17 Jun 2010,3.0 ,"Great little speaker for the price. Well-made speaker with nice zippered, snug-fitting carrying case. The sound from my iPod Touch in a large room is excellent for such a small speaker. Batteries easy to insert. Cord to mobile device can tuck away under speaker after use. One of those cheap electronic devices which offers such a pleasant surprise because of its unexpected quality. Unfortunately this device malfunctioned after about a month of use, and I had to discard it."
,,Tap Banister,You're taking a risk,19 Jun 2012,1.0 ,"This speaker works great and arrives pretty quickly, however this speaker will stop working for no particular reason like it did for me. I had been using it for a little over a month and then one day, I decide to put some new batteries in it and the power light would quickly flash red and would not function at all. I've tried other batteries and it still won't turn on. This was pretty much a waste of 20$. Avoid this purchase if you can."
,,Joben M Esslinger,"Mediocre sound, amazing battery life.",03 Feb 2012,4.0 ,"While the sound is impressive for the size of the speaker, it certainly isn't what I would call good. But don't let that stop you from buying this speaker. None of the speakers in this category actually sound good. The volume is very impressive. It is loud enough for me to listen in a mail truck with the window down, on a bumpy road. Those trucks are about as loud and rickety as it gets. The battery life is the most impressive part. I am on my 33 hour of talk radio podcasts, with the volume around 4 clicks off the max, on my ipod shuffle. This thing is still going!!! I was expecting it to die on the 5th day, but it just keeps going. That is only using alkaline batteries. I would imagine with nmh rechargeables, it will go longer."
,,semi-pro,LOOKS CAN BE DECIEVING,14 Jan 2014,5.0 ,"when i first saw this on amazon it looked like it has a metal housing. when i got this speaker it had a plastic housing; a very hard plastic that seems very durable. what won me over was the speaker size and battery life. even though this speaker gets very loud and has pretty good bass, it tends to lose quality and bass at extreme volumes, which is normal for any speaker of its size (who needs it that loud anyways?). this speaker is probably the best you can get for its size and has the longest battery life. be warned when you get this specific speaker, it doesn't come with a case; that's why you can get this for $20. you cant chain several of these like you can the Kinivo ZX-100 or the X-Mini. if you wanted stereo sound, then don't get this one. overall this is an incredible value and would recommend it to anybody."
,,Redbonecowgirl,Great…but,06 Mar 2014,4.0 ,I just wish the cord was much longer. It's for that very reason I ended up purchasing a bluetooth speaker (to use with my phone). But the sound on this speaker is much better than I expected even after reading reviews. I still use it primarily for my computer. Great price - great sound. It's not a Bose speaker but it holds its own for it's price range!
,,self-guided,meh,24 Feb 2012,2.0 ,"Bought this to take out while hiking and camping. Sounds pretty good, but if you overload it and turn the volume too loud there is the horrible screeching that everyone writes about. Sometimes the screeching happens for no real reason. My power switch will light on and off when I press the button - however the speaker keeps playing when I do this - so instead of turning off, it just constantly stays on. This results in the batteries draining if they are left in for extended periods of time (even when nothing is playing). What I've done is just take the batteries out after each use, but it gets to be a pain. And mine didn't come with a case...not sure if Altec Lansing stopped including those? Probably better products out there than this. Meh."
,,psycho,solid little speaker about the size of a can of tuna,22 Jan 2013,4.0 ,"i bought several of these type speakers to compare like the ihome and one other , this one had the best quality but it also is the biggest of the group and you have to buy batteries for it, they are not rechargeable, its a solid speaker for about 2o bucks. the only thing for me is that its a gimicky gadget and i used it a couple times and now it collects dust(not because its bad but because its a gadget (wow that looks cool i could use one of those and then you get it and your on to the next gadget)"
,,George H. Cole,This Speaker Kicks Ass,15 Nov 2011,5.0 ,"I did not expect this speaker to sound that good (I bought it because of the reviews). But when I hooked it up WOW! it sounds really good! Nice fidelity, you can hear the whole spectrum of frequencies (which I did not think it would). So as a bedside speaker for my Droid X it's perfect. It runs on batteries but they last a long time ~25 hrs, I haven't changed them yet. I am very pleased with this product and recommend getting it!"
,,Brodie,"Big sound, Small package, Just what I wanted!",28 Sep 2011,5.0 ,"You're not gonna get room-filling, super hi-fidelity, stereophonic sound, but that's not the point. What you will get is loud-and-clear sound in an ultra-portable package. It's loud enough to get the people upstairs pounding on the floor for me to turn it down. The included case is a really nice touch--icing on the cake. It's perfect for boosting the audio from your smart phones, tablets, and laptops while on-the-go. Especially useful for showing multimedia presentations during casual meetings. Few items to know about (could be good or bad, depending on your preference): 1. The audio cable is short, about 8 inches, max 2. It has no volume control of its own. You must control volume from the source device. 3. There is no auto-off feature--not sure how this affects battery life, but probably not good forgetting to turn it off. 4. The power button is small and just a little difficult to operate for someone with fat fingers. Overall, a high performer at a low price."
,,J.W.,"Awesome sound, short cord.",04 Jan 2011,4.0 ,"I just got my Altec Lansing Orbit. They sound TERRIFIC. Surprising bass, very balanced, clear. Some have complained that the speakers aren't very loud. True, the maximum volume isn't very high (there isn't a volume control, you control it via your mp3 player). But I think the wonderful sound quality trumps the lack of volume control. The only reason why I give the speakers 4 stars? 1. The cord that connects to your mp3 player is only about 6 inches long. I think the cord needs to be at least 12 inches long. The base makes it look like you can wind the cord underneath the unit... why have that ready to go and not take advantage? Weird. 2. Use of batteries. BYOB. 3. Lack of volume control on the unit. I get why they do this, but having a physical volume control would be nice (and not hard to do). Many users I know would use a tactile volume control on the speaker over the control on their mp3 player or iPod. 4. Input is not gold-plated. I can't hear it affect the sound, really. But the fact still messes with my valuation of the product psychologically. I wish I could give it 4.5 stars as I think that's more accurate. I've used it so far with my iPhone, iPod Classic and MacBook (White, bought late 2007), and it sounds terrific with all three."
,,R. Ohr,I love this speaker!,26 Feb 2011,5.0 ,"Based on a few of the comments made by others, I purchased one of the speakers and have been thrilled with its quality, portability, and ease of use. I liked it so much that I ordered a second one to take to work and use there. It is a cute little unit and looks nice in our office. Everyone enjoys the music we hear so nicely through it. I don't even mind the short cord since it tucks away so easily. I could not be more pleased!"
,,Jerry M. Johnson,"Small speaker, big sound",11 Nov 2011,5.0 ,"I purchased this little speaker on an impulse when the price dropped very low. I used it recently in a conference room connected to a laptop to provide sound during a presentation. It provided room filling and reasonably full bodied sound that does not seem possible given it's size. I like that it takes standard AAA batteries but I haven't had it long enough to run the batteries out yet. Here is a quick tip for better sound. Put this speaker in a corner and the bass and volume both improve. For the money and size, I doubt this speaker can be beat."
,,Hubert Curry,Altec Lansing iM227 Orbit MP3 Speaker - just right!,29 Jan 2012,5.0 ,"The Altec Lansing iM227 Orbit MP3 Speaker is an inexpensive 3-1/2"" round x 2"" high disc that can be used to listen to the recorded 'sounds' you normally listen to with earphones. Powered by three 'AAA' batteries, loaded through the twist off base, the audio loudness has NO separate volume control - just an on-off switch with an indicator light. The volume is controlled by the device you're listening to ( .mp3 player, cd player, radio, etc. ) This is the speaker you want when you're tired of the earplugs, or want to share with someone - at close quarters. The volume is only that which you get from the device you listen to and, thus, is not overwhelming, but is 'just right' for a moderately quiet, or quiet area. I'm GLAD I made this purchase!"
,,Kailua Steve,Surprisingly Good for the Money,11 Jun 2009,5.0 ,"Allows my iPod battery to last longer and allows sharing of music and videos w/o using headphones and splitters. This is a small, plastic housing containing one speaker, amplifier, and batteries. I didn't expect much, but when placed on a surface it has surprisingly pleasant tone at moderate volume. The bass is reduced when it is lifted, so it seems to actually have some acoustic engineering behind it. Comes with a cloth/cardboard case which offers some protection. It's worth the $$ IMHO."
,,Katherine,... 3 years and it is still working with a nice sound for the price,27 Apr 2015,5.0 ,"I've had this for about 3 years and it is still working with a nice sound for the price. About a year in, it started to become harder to turn the speaker off because of the button. I have to use my nails to pull the button out slightly for it to turn off. Pros: Portable Small Light Nice sound for the price Loud enough for personal use Has a good bass sound for something of its size Cheap price Cons: Button starts sticking after long time use Short cord"
,,Fernando,Amplified Speakers,12 Jul 2012,5.0 ,"Very Good Speakers. They work good, they are very portable and easy to use. They sound loud and clear enough. There are of course louder and maybe better sounding speakers. Such as the: The Pyle Audio PiP20 Portable Speaker System. Those are very portable amplified speakers, they all are loud enough and also sound good enough, but as I said, to me the PiP20 seems to sound much louder and better."
,,Lifehack G,I use it constantly,27 Oct 2012,5.0 ,"Plug it in to your ipod. Now you can carry it around. Voila! I carry this around the house and listen to audio books when I'm cleaning, doing dishes, even taking a shower, whatever. It's little, simple, uses plain old AAA batteries, and has great battery life. It's inexpensive and just a great little thing to have around, I have probably used mine for several hundred hours at least without any issues."
,,Amazon Customer,Five Stars,12 Jul 2018,5.0 ,Item arrived safe and sound and on time!
,,G. Wesley Aven,Best sound for the price,06 Aug 2013,5.0 ,"It sounds great for the price, batteries last a long time and it is durable if you just watch where the wire connects to the speaker. I had to buy the second one because of that but this time I put hot glue where the wire attaches and now it can take a lot of abuse. That isn't necessary if you are careful but I would pick up my phone with speaker attached forgetting the speaker was there and that puts a lot of stress on the wire."
,,Simple Usually Better,Great sound for a small size,02 Jul 2013,5.0 ,This is a really nice MP3 speaker. It sounds very good and uses batteries. It takes 3 AAA batteries which are available anywhere but I use rechargables. I can carry an extra set and put them in if it should run out of power. The batteries last quite a long time however. I have another brand that charges off of a computer or my cell phone charger. It is nice also but doesn't seem to run as long on a charge and doesn't sound as good. It is a little smaller however. This Altec Lansing is my favorite of the two. The only drawback is it has a short cord but that can be remedied by stopping in to Radio Shack or etc. It is kind of nice not to have long wires in the way.
,,Stephan Peter Konig,Not too bad....,23 May 2014,5.0 ,For such a tiny speaker it does not sound bad. It's actually the best I heard in this size. I bought this for travelling to hear my own music in my room or the bathroom when no iPhone connection was available and people have been surprised how good and reasonably loud the sound was. It's been part of my luggage ever since...
,,Andrew Galli,Excellent Sound from small form factor,07 Mar 2012,5.0 ,"I purchased a new MacBook Pro 15"" in 2012, and was a bit disappointed with the onboard speakers. Quite frankly, they suck. So I decided to install an external speaker to help boost the sound. My requirements -- (1) Don't was available USB Ports (you need them for powered device applications) so it has to be self-powered (2) it has to withstand being thrown in my suitcase This little guy rocks! It's about the size of a hockey puck and maybe 2X as tall, and with batteries still quite light. The speaker is impressive, the bass response is excellent for what it packs, and I think if you had a stereo splitter cable and another one, you'd be rockin' and rollin'. Anyway -- not much else to say, really, except that I can actually hear the audio from my MacBook! Yay!"
,,AndyK,"Very good little speaker, durable after 5 years.",02 Dec 2015,5.0 ,Great little speaker. Very portable. Still playing after five years. Decent battery life - just remember to turn off the speaker when you stop using it. Cord wraps neatly on the bottom and keeps it from getting damaged. Nice little foam carrying case to protect it when travelling.
,,Khas,I had been searching for a good speaker to use in my bathroom,26 Sep 2014,5.0 ,"For the price, this little speaker delivers incredible sound quality. I had been searching for a good speaker to use in my bathroom, and the few that I had tried did not deliver good sound over the shower running. The Altec Lansing iM227 delivers clear, crisp sound easily definable over the running water. The amount of bass it produces is also very surprising, given the small size. As for battery life, it uses 3x AAA batteries, and from my experience they last a long time (I use it for maybe 20 minutes every few days, and replace the battery once a year)."
,,Amaramar,Unbeatable for price,26 Apr 2009,5.0 ,"When I plugged in and turned up the sound I was, quite literally, astounded. Great range. Unbelievable bass for it's size. Great treble too. Very loud for it's tiny dimensions. Like really, this much sounds from that?! Looks good too. Sleek and pretty well designed. Comes with a great soft, padded case which does not increase the dimensions by much - so still very, very, very portable - even in the excellent case. Who needs stereo when mono sounds this good. Seriously."
,,Matthew Boardman,"Honest Review, Depending on what your looking for.",19 Jul 2013,4.0 ,"The speakers are loud, you can hear it clearly in or outside which is good. However, the bass does not thump.. just being honest. There's no volume setting on the speaker it-self. So using your cell phone or whatever device to adjust it. (That's not a problem) The only issue is, you have to adjust the volume max at about 90% other-wise it will be distorted. It works well, overall. This portable speaker works good with my cell phone to listen to some jams. It takes 3 triple A batteries. The only reason to buy it, is because of it's portable/small size and loud speaker compared to it's size. It's about the size of two hockey pucks stacked together. Still pretty small. I give it 4 stars."
,,Scott Ross,Good but not great mini-speaker,09 Jul 2011,4.0 ,"This speaker is really sturdy, well constructed, very portable and convenient option. Unlike the two-speaker options, having a single speaker limits significantly the pain of tangled cords. This speaker has an ingenious design where the cord wraps around the bottom in such a way that the cord stays untangled and the plug is protected. The reason I am giving this speaker 4 stars is sound quality and volume control. The instructions say that the best sound quality will be when you set the volume of your device to between 85-90% of maximum. I have found it to be more like 80-85%. Even at that level the speaker distorts from time to time. The speaker has no volume control of its own. The volume is controlled exclusively by the device. I have a friend who has the X-Mini II speakers. They put out more volume with less distortion than this speaker. Unfortunately, they also go bad on users frequently. I suppose its a trade off."
,,Amazon Customer,Great Sound Quality from A Small Package,17 Apr 2014,5.0 ,"I use this little speaker with my iPod, and occasionally plug it into my laptop. I am always amazed at the volume and quality of the sound from this little speaker. It is sturdy, has well thought-out design, and the battery life is very good. Not audiophile quality -- but better than any other small speaker I have tried."
,,eggal,Perfect,28 Aug 2014,5.0 ,"I bought this in April of 2009 and it lasted through five years of camping trips where it got dirty, wet, covered in fire ash, dropped and left out in the cold and heat. This thing was a beast and I mourn its loss. I'll be buying a replacement for sure. Sound is loud and clear and 3 AAA batteries last an acceptable amount of time. Carrying case is great."
,,Z-man,Long Term Review,12 Dec 2012,5.0 ,"When I purchased this I was only expecting the equivalent of a large headphone. I was quite mistaken. The sound quality from this single speaker is quite good. It makes for livening up a camping trip, or a small boat, even a morning shower. I was lucky enough to get this on sale for about 20 bucks when I purchased it. Its been worth it. My complaints however would be that though it does have a very long battery life (about 2 days if used right) it still runs on triple-A's as opposed to having an internal rechargeable battery. And two, yes the upper case is aluminum however the lower (darker grey) section is still plastic. Props though as it has been dropped several times and still hasn't cracked."
,,T,Bang for the buck!!!,02 Oct 2011,5.0 ,"I bough the X-Mini II first and it's pretty good. Comes with a built in rechargeable battery and a ability to link more than one together. I was using it to listen to books on tape quite a bit. It was just too quiet sometimes. So I read the reviews of the Altec Lansing and decided to try it out next. I knew I could link them together if need be. Wow were the reviews right, it sounded so much better it felt like I had wasted my money on the X-Mini II. Oh well live and learn. It is bigger, probably double that of the X-Mini II. It uses 3AAA batteries instead of a built in battery but depending on what you want that is good or bad. The Altec Lansing has a fuller sound, It is also just plain louder. The X-Mini II is no where near as loud. It has a tinny sound especially when at the top range of the volume. I've been using it now for 3 months, no buyers remorse at all."
,,Mj4NU,Downfall,25 Aug 2013,2.0 ,"I received this product and used it twice when I had it hooked up to a ghost box and it worked great for that & replay of my recorder. I then had company over and thought I would try to hook it up again, there was lots static like there maybe a lose wire or something. (This item was never dropped and carried & stored in a padded case). Very disappointed in this product."
,,Victor,Excellent value and quality for the size,17 Jan 2010,5.0 ,"Despite its limitations, this IS one of the best audio products I've ever bought (of course, it doesn't come close to a component audio system, but who would make such an unfair comparison?). The speaker is VERY loud, filling an entire big room with sound - unless there is something wrong with your sound source. The design is ingenious in its minimalism - it is shaped like a speaker driver that it is, which makes perfect sense. It is definitely much better in sound quality and loudness than any laptop speakers, and better even than some bigger computer speaker systems (in particular, provides enough low frequency extension without the boomy distorted annoying pseudo-base you hear even in more expensive systems) PROS: very loud, great sound quality for the size, both on rock and ""acoustic""-type material. You can enjoy listening to it for hours: sound distortions don't stand out like with other small speakers. Batteries (3xAAA) last a long time. Extremely convenient and light-weight. CONS: no AC power option (but no need for it). Would be great if there was an option to connect a second identical speaker to get a stereo sound. Sounds somewhat harsh in upper midrange, but this isn't bothersome, and the sound is not fatiguing. Not so great instrument separation with classical music, but one can't expect more from a small mono speaker driver."
,,tiger,Great product!,05 Oct 2010,5.0 ,I was skeptical at first because I doubt that the sound is any good from just one speaker. I was very pleasantly surprised that the sound is very good and clear. And it is loud enough to be heard around the dinner table. The sound is about the same as my boombox. The speaker looks sturdy and I like the pouch that comes with it. It is highly portable. My 10-year-old daugther enjoyed listening to it with my ZUNE in the backseat of my car. Excellent buy. Highly recommended.
,,Erin C. Harris,LOVE IT,11 Feb 2010,5.0 ,"I had another larger, bulkier portable speaker set for our zune and the sound was TERRIBLE. Altec lansing gets it right with their products! My sister introduced me to this as she plugged her iPhone into it and we played Pandora tunes while in a rented Condo and I could not believe how good the sound was compared to other speakers I have heard. I got one for my daughter's room to play from the zune in there - any device works! It is by no means BOSE surround sound, but it is FABULOUS for the price! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!"
,,NicoleMiles,The Best,11 Jan 2013,5.0 ,"I have done tons of research trying to find The Best mini speaker, and it came down to this one versus the X-mini and AYL speakers. I've bought all three. This one is bigger, but definitely has the best sound quality and bass. My dad stole mine, so I'll probably buy another. It doesn't have the sleek convertible-red beauty of the other two speakers, but it gives off tons of volume and great sound quality."
,,tmd54,"actually, already reviewed this",22 Mar 2014,5.0 ,"while i love the speaker and do recommend it, please be aware that altec lansing sold and this product is no longer made and therefore no real guarantees if something goes wrong. i use it to carry my ipod shuffle from room to room while i work. (it is hard for me to work with ear buds on) good sound. i bought 3 of these things."
,,mayfayre,Great Little Speaker But Cord Is Too Short,19 Jan 2011,4.0 ,"I'm not an audiophile so I can't seriously address the quality of the music from this speaker, but to my ears it is very good. I bought this speaker as part of my seemingly eternal quest to find an external speaker to work with my computer laptop which is easily portable, has good sound, and is easy to use. I happen to have a Dell laptop with truly lousy speakers - the sound is very compressed and tinny. So when I want to listen to music on it, or play games that have soundtracks I want a speaker that can reproduce sound well. This speaker can do that. It is a single-piece speaker, which is good. The plug is pre-attached to it, and is stored in the bottom of the speaker, also very good. A nice padded case comes with the speaker - very good for transportation and storage. I haven't had any problem with the on-off button, and I like the fact that the speaker actually has one. My problem with this speaker is that the speaker cord is too short for my purpose. I am not using this speaker with my MP3 player or with my phone, where I would just put both devices on the table or some other flat surface. I am using it with my laptop - which is usually on my lap. The speaker cord is maybe about 10 inches long, which is not enough to stretch from my lap to the nearest flat surface. There's not enough room to put it on the laptop itself and if I put it on my leg, it usually winds up falling off. Luckily, in my situation, I happen to have an extension earphone cord that fits perfectly on the speaker plug and which extends its length so that I am able to put the speaker on a nearby table. So I would recommend that anyone buying this speaker to use it with a laptop also buy an extension cord/plug for it. One quality issue: the zipper on the storage case seems to have been mis-stitched in a section (unless that's supposed to be some odd bit of design style). It is still usable."
,,DC,Good for Price,27 Nov 2012,5.0 ,"I got it for $17 back in December 2010. For the price, it packs a punch and has good battery life. I use it with my ipod touch. I noticed that for songs with alot of bass, when my ipod touch cranked to full volume, the sound does get muddled a bit, but if you're in an environment (whether outdoors or with alot of background noise) where you need something that loud, you're not going to find anything that can produce the sound you're looking for at this price."
,,Mountain Mac,exceeds expectations,11 Jun 2012,5.0 ,"this product exceeded my expectations in terms of sound quality and volume. bass is awesome, sounds very clear. I bought this primarily for calling birds such as owls, but I tested it with music also and it sounds amazing. Already used it successfully to call in a Bicknells Thrush (rarest thrush that breeds in the states) up near Mt. Washington. Worked like a charm. As far as negatives on this product, I can only say that the cord that connects to the MP3 is very short, and the cord itself is very thin and seems like it may be vulerable. If you are careful not to stress the cord you should definately get your moneys worth before anything goes wrong. Cheap enough that if you have to replace it in a few years, no big deal.If you are looking for something that will take a lot of abuse and will last a long time, by all means, try spending more money, but I'm pleased with the Altec."
,,C. Nash,Not too shabby unless you're expecting Bose,07 Dec 2011,5.0 ,"Granted, I just received this item so I have no idea how long it will hold up but for what I wanted it's just fine. You can't expect much more than this for the price. I wanted something I could use with my mp3 player and my tablet and sit it on the nightstand or take along with me and it does the job. A lot of times I just don't feel like wearing buds or headphones. Make sure you turn OFF any bass enhancement on your device before you try it. Also don't crank your device volume all the way up. I have mine playing fairly loudly now and it sounds good...for what it is. I would suggest using rechargeable batteries, for the environment, of course, as well as your wallet. I guess the cord could be a bit longer. Other than that, I'm pleased with this little puppy. If you want thumping bass and something you can hear all over your house at a loud volume you probably ought to look for something more expensive (or run your devices through that fancy home theater system you have). :-) Nice buy."
,,Kathy,Works great with my Droid x,08 Jan 2011,5.0 ,"I was kind of confused about where it said ""Conveniently connects to any music player with 3.5-mm connection and music phones with 2.5-mm adapter (not included)"" because I didn't know what connection size my Droid x has, but I took a chance and it works perfectly with it without needing an adapter. The sound quality is great. I use my phone for listening to music and talk radio and everything is as clear as a bell. I'd highly recommend this speaker."
,,Kip Mitchell,best bang for your buck,31 Jan 2010,4.0 ,"If you want something to throw in your suitcase while you travel, this is the product for you. With all the mixed reviews on this product I felt compelled to write one myself after receiving the Altec Lansing iM-237. First of all you are buying a battery operated, portable, single speaker. That being said, it lives up to my every need including sound quality. For $30 you are not going to find a better portable speaker on the market. I travel a lot and was in the market for something to boost the regular iPhone speaker while in the hotel. Not only did it boost the sound, it became a very capable sound system. I mainly listen to Rock but experimented with all types of music from Rap to Electronic. I was very surprised how well this little speaker handled everything even at close to maximum volume without distortion. Don't be turned away from poor sound quality reviews. I just don't understand these reviewers' expectations."
,,Scott J,"Great little powerhouse, unbelievable value!!",30 Oct 2011,5.0 ,"I have an iPhone/iPod that I wanted to use to play audio excerpts for groups of people up to 30 or so. I found this item on Amazon and it seemed to be the one people liked, overall, the best. For roughly $13 it is AMAZING to me what this little cylinder does. 3 AAA batteries later, I have a device which is unbelievably compact and portable, which, when coupled with my iPhone, is MORE than adequate for a large living room full of people to hear, VERY CLEARLY, what I am playing for them. Look, this little speaker isn't going to power a disco dance floor or music for a wedding reception, but if you need something to be able to hear your content from any sort of portable player, you won't be disappointed in the least by this little powerhouse. I must also add that to me, its tonal quality, absent much bass (hey, what can you really expect from a 2"" driver?!), is superb overall in view of its dimunutive stature. For what it is, you can't go wrong. Just order it!"
,,G. Fujioka,Remember to turn it off!,24 Feb 2013,3.0 ,"These are a decent adjunct to your little device when you need a bit more volume. They run on AAA batteries, and if you forget to turn it off, when you come back you've just wasted three Energizers. I used this for my Mom while she was in hospice. She loved Frank Sinatra and spent her last days listening to him through this little Altec Lansing."
,,MarkM007,Love it!,02 Sep 2011,5.0 ,"I purchased this speaker for my desktop. Sometimes I just don't feel like cranking up the stereo or putting on headphones or earbuds. For a little speaker this one puts out a nice clear sound and I was pleasantly surprised at how loud it is. I crank it up to about 75-80% of its power and that is plenty. For $18.49 this was simply a steal. In fact, after receiving it, and using it, I ordered another as a spare. Altek Lansing has a good reputation and that was one of the reasons I bought it. Also, most Amazon reviewers ranked it high with 4 stars or more."
,,Don,Altec Lansing iM227 MP3 Speaker,22 Jan 2012,5.0 ,"I purchased this speaker so my wife could use it with her portable CD player when listening to books. When working around the house she can't keep the CD player with her and therefore can't use headphones. Well, I was very impressed with the quality of this speaker and the quality of sound. The volume, which is adjusted on the MP3 device (her CD player in this case), is very adequate. I like the speaker so much I find that I sometimes use it when I am listening to iHeart radio and can't use headphones or another amplifier. Prior to purchasing this speaker on line, I listened to several other speakers like this in stores and did not like them. The were flimsy and didn't sound all that great. This Altec speaker is far superior in all respects and it isn't very large either. I would recommend this product to anyone needing this type of speaker."
,,Danny D,Great little portable speaker,05 Mar 2014,4.0 ,"This speaker has great sound in a very small package. My only complaint is that the chord is pretty short. You can buy an extender pretty cheaply, so not a major concern. I chose this over others because it has removable batteries. I don't like proprietary batteries that you can't replace. I use rechargable AAA amazon batteries and they last probably 48 hrs or so of playing before needing a charge. Very pleased overall."
,,Lynny,Good little speaker,21 Dec 2014,5.0 ,"This is a great speaker for the price. I use it around the house, mostly for audiobooks or podcasts. Decent sound, good battery life, sturdy, light enough for travel. Liked them so much I bought a handful for stocking stuffers. Note there is no volume control - need to use your player device to adjust. The input cord tucks neatly underneath. It's rather short."
,,Kindle Customer,WOW! is this thing LOUD and CLEAR!!!,20 May 2014,5.0 ,"Hey, if you want to play your fav MP#'s while you clean house and blast the music like you're still 15 and trying to annoy your parents with Metallica? This is it! LOL I have heard so many bad reviews and tried more than a few of these speakers myself, but I decided to give it one more try and I'm so glad I did! NO distortion and it's just SHOCKINGLY LOUD for such a little thing--try it, you won't be sorry..."
,,MAJINFEYD,Good Sound But An Awful Product That Must Be Made In The Worst Electronics Factory In China,21 Jan 2015,1.0 ,The sound was good but tthis item was so cheap the grill came off after about 4 uses and after about 5 uses the cord came out totally destroying the playability of the product! I did absolutely nothing to abuse it and it just pretty much fell apart on me. I am a fan of Altec Lansing's sound but their products don't measure up when it comes to durability. I won't buy an Altec Lansing product again just based on the past few experiences I have had with their stereos and cannot recommend them at all to anybody.
,,BLDCNMDH,Very cool!,13 Nov 2015,4.0 ,"This little speaker is awesomeness! It will make a difference in your music listening guys, it has a nice audio really with base and all, it is very cool all i can say. I even made a detailed video review of this here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnWJBRCdXts"
,,Robert,Robust Performer,17 Dec 2010,5.0 ,"What I liked: - Surprisingly good sound (quality and volume) from such a small unit. - Priced right. - Built tough. - Battery operated (recommend rechargeable AAA NiMH batteries, such as Eneloops) - Nifty carrying case. What I didn't like: - No volume control. - Short audio cord. Bottom line: Solidly built. Nothing fancy here, just amplified-sound-on-the-go at a fair price. If you want an audiophile experience, go elsewhere. If you simply want to pump out the music, this is a good option."
,,C. Allen,Great for the price!,17 Apr 2011,4.0 ,"Love this speaker. It making listening to my iPhone music actually enjoyable. It sounds so good that my husband took mine. So I came back to order one more and noticed that it went more than 50% in price since I bought it (less than 2 weeks ago). Disappointed that I got it for double the price, but I should be happy that I can get my second one for this price.... It comes in a nice little case which makes it very nice and portable especially for my husband who travels a lot. It does not have a volume control, so you have to adjust volume on your device (iPhone, iPod, etc.). That's the only reason I gave a 4 star, but again, I probably shouldn't be complaining for this price..."
,,yespat,Works Like a Charm,26 Oct 2012,5.0 ,"Pop in the batteries and works just as advertised. As I only listen to audiobooks, it does not matter to me that it is not stereo. Small and compact, easy to operate and it come with a very nice carrying case. What more could you want? I like that it works with batteries too because with the rechargeable kind, what do you do once it no longer holds a charge? It's great."
,,Mira864,NO CASE!!! Don't buy if you think you are getting a case too!,13 Jan 2012,2.0 ,"So Disappointing!!! I travel internationally a lot, and I left this wonderful little speaker and it's fabulous grey case with a very good friend in Paraguay, as he loved it. I thought I could simply order another on Amazon for myself. WRONG!!! Lansing Altek no longer includes this wonderful little case with the product. And Amazon -- deceitfully -- doesn't tell you that the older model DOES include the case! I would have gladly paid more for the case, as I travel internationally and it was much safer in my handbag with a case. I guess I can have one made inexpensively when I go abroad, but what a pain. On a more positive note, I truly LOVE this little speaker. The sound quality is good, and it's so nice to use with your computer when you're watching a movie or your ipod when you want to listen to music and traveling or cooking in the kitchen."
,,Anthony Stone,sounds great for a little speaker,10 May 2011,5.0 ,"Just thought I'd leave some feedback on this little sucker! It kicks major butt! It even gives louder sound to my laptop which is very unaudible if anythings running in the background like say an a/c or heater in the winter! My ONLY complaint is with the UPS as I ordered it on 1st day shipping for friday and the idiot ""claimed"" I was ""closed"" [not a business btw] and delivered it on Monday AFTER 7pm! Amazon was great about it though as they refunded the full price of the postage [because it wasnt their fault!] As far as the design goes I wish theyed made the connection cord longer but with a headphone extention cord I was all set! It also inproves the sound of the small sounding grindy sound of the Blackberry Curve! As far as worksmanship goes/batt life etc. I cant comment on that right now because I just recieved it last night however I'm happy with it thus far! price on it should be lower though....the sale price of $17 bucks should be its reg price! I paid full price for it last week!"
,,Media Lover,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS!!!!!",10 Feb 2015,5.0 ,"I'm a music lover so this speaker goes wherever I go and it's never failed me! I cannot recommend this highly enough. It's sturdy, sounds great for such a small speaker (not tinny) and I can play my tunes from my iphone, laptop, iPad...whatever!"
,,G. Ishii,Good while it lasted,22 Jun 2013,3.0 ,"For the price, this speaker sounded decent, and had some good qualities; like an on/off button with light designation, tool-less battery replacement, self-contained cord storage (although cord is really short), and good looks/solid build. However, longevity is not one of it's good traits. I had mine for about a year and a half, then it suddenly stopped working. Tried replacing the batteries , but still doesn't work properly. I can hear some sound coming out from the speaker, but it is very faint, so it went into file 13."
,,Norton Peabody,Surprisingly Good...,31 Oct 2011,4.0 ,"Having purchased a number of small portable speakers over the last few years, I can honestly say this is the best so far. With a reasonable set of expectations, (hey, it's a single 2"" driver powered by 3 AAA batteries) the iM227 really shines. Good full range sound and decent volume levels. I've shown this thing to a number of people and they all seem to have the same reaction... surprise at the sound quality of such a small device. The 3.5 mm audio input is a little on the short side but it is compact and stores neatly under the speaker. So far over 20+ hours on a single set of alkaline batteries and still going. Well worth the current $15.00 price, have purchased several more after receiving my original."
,,Pathfinder,Great Little Speaker,04 May 2010,5.0 ,"I was looking for a small, portable speaker for my Ipod Touch and was lured into buying those tiny, black, mushroom looking little speakers based on their good reviews. Bad move for me. They sounded like an old transistor radio on steroids. I realize the shortcomings of tiny speakers but these were just unacceptable to me and I returned them. I came upon the Altec Lansing im-237's and they also had glowing reviews. Considering Altec Lansing's reputation, I ordered one, hoping that this time, I would get reasonable sound from a very small speaker. I was not disappointed! This little speaker is amazing for its size. I was not expecting a whole lot considering it's a single speaker and very small but it truly surprised me with the sounds that came from it. My ipod Touch pumped Phil Keaggy guitar solos through it while I munched my lunch and it was very, very, enjoyable. By all means get this speaker, you won't be sorry!"
,,M. ONLINE,Bought them all and recommend the Altec Lansing,20 Dec 2011,5.0 ,"I bought one of pretty much every external speaker out there as stocking stuffers this year. HANDS DOWN this one has the best sound. The others may look cool but when you boil it down, what really matters is the sound quality and this one actually has some decent bass to it. You will definitely not be powering any parties with it, but for watching movies, playing some background music OR using as a speakerphone for hands free, this one is just the best."
,,Joanna,The best for the price,18 Oct 2009,5.0 ,"I was looking for a small speaker system for my ipod. I researched a lot and this one seemed to win the most positive reviews. Other than the cord being ridiculously short, the thing ROCKS. The sound is loud, clear, and you will be shocked at how great it sounds for a) how small it is and b)how inexpensive it is. I can't believe I'm writing a review, but it's so rare to be pleasantly surprised, so I had to. Thirty bucks? A deal."
,,D. Connell,"Failed after 4 months, promptly replaced",14 Apr 2012,3.0 ,"i purchased a iM237 in October, in February it began playing only the left or right track on some tunes. It does not appear to be damaged, it simply doesn't work well. It appears from the other reviews that most everyone has had a good experience with this speaker, then again I don't trust the reviews on Amazon. Buyer beware. postscript: altec lansing send me a replacement immediately. good company."
,,D. Heinsohn,Solid Simple Amplified Speaker,11 Sep 2011,4.0 ,"I needed a speaker to use in a 3"" pipe enclosure. This is the speaker I chose. I have removed it from that enclosure and now use it in a variety of places where a simple mono amplified speaker is needed. I've primarily used it to listen to audio books. In a modestly quiet environment it is easier to use than a set of headphones. The overall sound quality is better than expected from such a small unit. The audio power is not great, but I would not expect it to be room filling. It does not seem to use batteries quickly, as I'm still on my first set after several hours of listening."
,,Dan Leifker,Great for carrying from room to room,11 Nov 2013,5.0 ,"I like to play podcasts when I clean my house or am just puttering around from room to room, and this speaker is perfect for that. I hook up my iPhone to this speaker and put it on a large thin book (to act as a tray) and I can carry it from room to room very easily. The sound really booms and sounds like it's coming from a much bigger speaker. The only thing I dislike: it's easy to forget to turn it off, and that drains the battery. Would be nice if it turned off automatically when you disconnect it from your audio source. But for the price it's a nifty little speaker that I use all the time."
,,Linda Kozel,Good,30 Jun 2018,3.0 ,Very good
,,Happy Customer,"Great sound, great price",03 Oct 2012,5.0 ,"This speaker offers clear, crisp sound and a lot of volume in a small package. Pros: well priced; great highs and mids; uses 3 AAA batteries (built in rechargeable batteries lose their ability to hold a charge over time) Cons: A bit large for a portable speaker; bass could be a bit better although pretty good for a portable speaker; input wire is a little flimsy; uses 3 AAA batteries (you'll need to replace the batteries and even if you use rechargeables to cut down cost it's still a little less convenient) Conclusion: If you're looking for a portable speaker that offers loud, clear sound for a reasonable price then this is the speaker for you."
,,Mike,Sounds pretty good,12 Jan 2011,5.0 ,"I got this for my wife to use with her Zune HD, and I gotta say... I'm pretty impressed with the sound quality! She leaves it on a shelf in the bathroom to use when she's doing the whole relaxing in the tub thing. Previously, she'd just plug in my studio headphones and CRANK up the volume... which is certainly not ideal. This little thing puts out a decent amount of bass for its size, and the overall sound quality is pretty sharp. No overmodulation unless you're deliberately TRYING to push it over its limit. The only additional thing I'd want on it is its own volume wheel (volume is adjusted via the source, i.e.: MP3 player, laptop etc), but that's a pretty negligible missing feature to me. Maybe just a LITTLE pricey for what it is, but it's a damn convenient gadget overall."
,,Bonch,"So much for so little. Sound, portability, protection, battery life:",16 Nov 2010,4.0 ,"This was quite possibly the most sensible purchase I've made in terms of mp3 related items. The sound is all ready to go, you adjust the volume according to your device. The idea of one speaker feeds an immediate displeasing perception of the item. However, do not be fooled by its circular shape and seemingly fragile appearance. The arrangement is practical. No, it cannot contain your device, it is for enjoying while being stationary; yet the purchase includes a nifty carrying case along with a carabiner, in case you decide to be on the move. The sound alone is reason enough to buy this. I was concerned with the quality, but surprisingly, for the amount, the noise pays back tenfold. The battery life is a lot more reliable than most portable mp3 players. This device usually lasts 12 hours or more. It's durable, portable, it's got great sound and it's affordable; point blank: must buy."
,,Tasha,Short life,20 Jul 2012,1.0 ,"I trusted most of the positive reviews this product had, but the first altec lansing orbit speaker I received stopped working once playing it only a 3rd time. I made sure to keep the volume below the max, and I even the changed batteries. My iPod was fully charged. I asked for a replacement, and it worked great for a while but after about a month of using it (again, being careful to never put the volume on max) the sound became quieter and fuzzier. Once again I changed the batteries. This time, the speaker wouldn't even turn on! I tried several times but to no avail. My iPod was fully charged like last time. The green light would not show up. I would take out the batteries and put them back in, but still nothing. I am starting to become a believer of 'too good to be true' in terms of electronics. I feel like I wasted a lot of my time on this shoddy product. I would not buy anything like this again."
,,AZ buyer,End of battery squeal,11 Jul 2012,3.0 ,"When the batteries are no longer strong enough to support the speaker, then the speaker squeals. (If you fell asleep while listening, it is a rude awakening.) There is a battery indicator light that is green when the batteries are strong, and it turns red when they are weaker, but it will be on red a while before it goes to squealing."
,,Andrew Lynn,"Good, simple, cheap",07 Jun 2013,5.0 ,"For something this small that costs this little, this speaker is pretty remarkable. I take it on vacations or use it at my desk when I want more power from my laptop or iPod. The batteries last forever, the sound is pretty good and it's really simple. Just plug it in and press the on button, and control the volume from the computer."
,,DD,It worked and then it didn't....,21 Apr 2012,1.0 ,"Got this speaker and immediately packed it in my suitcase for our vacation. Didn't have batteries yet so hoped it worked. Got to our destination and bought batteries, put them in and it sounded ok. Tried again with the mp3 player and thought ok this will be good enough. Changed to a different song and all of a sudden no sound. Light is still on but no sound. Plugged in headphones to mp3 and that worked so tried speaker on my phone and nope no sound it is busted! Bummer no speaker for vacation now. Returning for refund."
,,R. J. Atkinson,"Two years later, still my favorite...",31 Aug 2013,5.0 ,I purchased this speaker two years ago and it finally gave out after being seriously beat up on camping and beach trips. I purchased a different brand and newer model to replace it and the stupid thing broke after a couple months. So I went back to my old faithful and purchased this one again. One thing you should always consider with portable speakers is the battery. A lot of the new portable speakers come with batteries that can only be recharged by a computer. How the heck will you charge it while on vacation? I love that this takes AAA batteries and you can buy them anywhere. No computer needed. Love it. Won't ever buy anything else.
,,Bex,Highly Impressed and Satisfied,27 Nov 2011,5.0 ,"I just want to say that I never review products, however I am so pleased with this product and I want other people to know how wonderful it is. I bought this to plug into my computer because this is what I use the majority of the time to watch TV with and I was sick of the sound having no depth. For the light weight and small size of this speaker I was blown away by the sound it produced. It is clear and can get to a nice volume level. I have used this speaker with my computer as well as my iphone. The portability of the speaker has also been extremely impressive, I can throw it in my hand-bag and take it anywhere. Beach, friends house, ect. Finally my one concern about it not being rechargeable has been thrown out the window. I have had the speaker for two months and use it almost daily, I have not had to change the three-triple A batteries I put in on the first day. AMAZING BUY FOR THE PRICE AND PROVIDED ENJOYMENT!"
,,Sammie,Better than expected,28 Mar 2013,5.0 ,"I bought this to listen to my iPod in my car while driving long distances. I feel safer using it rather than earphones while driving. It works great. It was so cheap I thought it might sound ""tinny"" but it doesn't. The sound is much better than I expected (but I wasn't expecting alot). Volume is fine too. Exactly what I wanted. Very pleased."
,,Hallucinating Elvis,Simply Fantastic,23 Oct 2009,5.0 ,"Like the title says, this little speaker is simply fantastic. I use it mostly when I listen to talk radio, but it's also great for out in the garage listening to music when I'm working, or out on our back deck. The batteries seem to last forever as long as you're not cranking full volume all the time. Also great for the bathroom when you're having a bath or shower and want to hear some tunes. Just take this and your mp3 player and your good to go."
,,Russ Anderley,Great Loud Sound for the Size and Price,12 Mar 2011,5.0 ,"Prior to this purchase, I had a Logitech speaker system (that charged as well) that I thought was great until it burned out after a year and a half. I bought this because of the price and great reviews. Though it doesn't charge the Ipod, it does an amazing job and has a great battery life. I was concerned about its size, thinking it would not be loud enough to use outdoors on a camping trip or by the pool. I was pleasantly surprised at its volume and sound quality. It matched my previous system on these aspects at a much lower price, and is much more portable. Indoors and outdoors, I keep the volume on my ipod between 50-75% and it is plenty loud enough for everyone to hear. The sound quality is great for such a small and cheap speaker. Comes with a nice case and is very conveniently engineered to be on the go. Great product."
,,C Augustus,Worked great...until the speaker blew.,21 Jan 2013,3.0 ,"I actually liked this little speaker. It has great sound and doesn't gobble up the batteries. I bought a second one for a friend & its still working fine. Problem: I bought my speaker on 12/31/11 and the speaker suddenly blew this morning (1/21/13). So it lasted a little more than a year. I didn't use it heavily, just a few times a week for 20-30 min while getting ready for work."
,,Mark Allen G. Garzon,LOUD!,04 Sep 2009,5.0 ,"I was looking for a speaker to boost the volume of both my underpowered MacBook and decent sounding iPhone 3GS. I mostly use the MacBook to teleconference and the internal speaker just doesn't cut it. Often times it's drowned out by secondary noises like traffic and the television. The same goes with the speaker with the iPhone. So with that set of criteria, I was on a search for an inexpensive portable speaker to compliment the two items. I shopped around online and came across the reviews for the iM-237. With some skepticism I ended up ordering it since the price ($28 with delivery) was in my budget. After arrival, I plugged it in and was....TOTALLY BLOWN AWAY! This speaker is LOUD and relatively clear for a portable one piece unit! My skepticism was quickly brushed aside. Teleconferencing was much improved along with songs/videos played from the iPhone. It has decent bass and terrific clarity even when the volume is turned up all the way (which I haven't done much since it's plenty loud). All in all, I HIGHLY recommend this for an inexpensive, portable speaker option."
,,W. Miyamoto,... used this for a few years and it was good on the road,31 Jul 2017,3.0 ,I used this for a few years and it was good on the road. But I found a more multi-functional and better audio quality (and wireless) wit hthe Jabra speakerphone.
,,sgrams,good sound,08 Feb 2012,5.0 ,"I am pleased with this speaker, I read the reviews on it versus other similar speakers and I believe this is worth the cost. I use it mainly for my mp3 player, it plugs into the headphone jack. I also take it to work to plug into computers to listen to internet radio, because we have no control over the sound quality on work computers the sound quality isn't as good. Another person at work bought the iHome Rechargeable Mini Speaker to use with his mp3 player, we tried both speakers separately on his player and I thought the Altec Lansing had better deeper sound. This requires three AAA batteries, I bought some rechargeable batteries but the original batteries (not included) are still working, because I use it so intermittently I can't say how long batteries last but they must have at least 15 hours total right now."
,,Sean Brown,Stopped working after 3 days....,25 Apr 2012,1.0 ,"I was in love when I first had my music blasting at work. Once the first cheap pair of batteries I bought went out, I went and purchased some expensive energizer batteries...For whatever reason, the damn thing would not come back on. I then took back my energizers (stupidly thinking it was the batteries) and bought the same cheap ones that I was using before....Still didn't work. I'm guessing the unit is bad. Sucks too because I'm lucky enough to have a job were I can listen to music but my phones speaker is too dang on low and this was just what I needed.... Too bad.."
,,C. E. Gregory,Impressive sound!,28 Dec 2009,5.0 ,"I am very impressed at the sound you get from this item! I use it at my desk at work and the small size makes it ideal for a small space and makes easy to stow in my computer bag. I purchased rechargable batteries to make it more reasonable to use as I didn't like the thought of throwing out a lot of batteries. There is an initial invetment with rechargables, but in the long run they make sense. Great gift item!"
,,VTwinVal,Excellent Product,19 Jan 2009,5.0 ,"I purchased this w/o a demo because of the brand name. I am not disappointed. The sound is unbelievable when you consider the size. It is beyond portable! It fits in a saddle bag w/no problem. No electricity needed, although that option would be nice. Roadtrips? Camping? Picnic/Day in the park? I recommend this speaker...I bought one for my nephew who uses it w/his Mac laptop (for movies) because of the quality. PS...No this is not a Bass Box.... :)"
,,Ken,Altec Lansing iM227 Orbit speaker,25 Sep 2011,5.0 ,"This is a nice little speaker. Not very bassy, however, but you'll never get much base out of such a small speaker. I plug this into my Ipod at work, which has a lot of background noise, and it does the job nicely. I've not tried it on my netbook yet, but I'm sure that it is much louder than the lousy speakers that the netbook came with. Very much worth the money spent, which wasn't very much. A great deal."
,,JeepChef,Great sound for the size,24 Aug 2011,5.0 ,These sound pretty good for a little portable speaker. Takes 3 AAA batteries. There is a power light that turns red when the batteries start to go. The battery life seems decent as well. The cord is a little short but not a reason to not buy. I bought 2 and a splitter for my iPod. Pretty loud for the size! I liked these because they come with a little protective case. They are just a bit shy of being the size of a softball for reference.
,,Meredith Gould,Terrific Little Speaker,09 Sep 2015,5.0 ,"An older version of this died after almost 6 years of heavy use, so I knew I had to get another. Although audiophilies might have ""issues,"" the sound is perfectly fine for binge watching crap online. Portable, light. Just remember it's attached when you move your laptop/tablet so you don't jerk the cord."
,,Jay Bandoy,Ahhhh-mazing! Best portable speakers!,02 Jan 2011,5.0 ,"When I shop at Ross or Bed Bath and Beyond, I'm always tempted to get some portable speakers for my mp3 player to use around the apartment. (Turning on the computer, waiting for it to boot up, loading iTunes, is just too time consuming for me!) The inexpensive speakers usually go for about $8, but save your money and toss in some extra dough for these bad boys. You will NOT be disappointed. (Check out ) The Altec Lansing iM-237 Orbit Ultraportable Speaker have such a powerful punch for such a small device. I'll connect it to my iPod Touch, play some Pandora and I can hear the music perfectly at only 70%. What you'll want to do is add this to your Wish List. Check on it every now and then. Sometimes it will be over $20, but I might have lucked out and got it at $17. Maybe it was a holiday sale? Not sure. But get this speaker. You'll LOVE it."
,,coad,altec speaker ROCKS!,24 Jun 2011,5.0 ,"This thing is perfect for poolside music, a trip to the beach, or travel. I haven't changed the batteries (3 AAA) since I got it, and have used it a total of around 20 hours. I use it to listen to my Sony Walkman and Pandora on my Droid. Sound quality is much better than I expected from such a small item, though it is a little directional. Also it is LOUD. Not wake-the-neighbors loud, but enough that in a crowd of 8 people in a room, laughing and drinking, it was loud enough to hear over the group. I am gonna get another one to use at work."
,,TOOOOSCARRRRY,Amazing Portable Speaker,28 Feb 2012,5.0 ,"I purchased the Altec Lansing iM227 Orbit speaker to listen to music from my phone while at work. I fully expected to have to have the volume all the way up to listen to it from about 15 feet away. At only half volume this speaker is more than loud enough, even with noise from machines that I work around in the background. For such a tiny speaker the sound quality is very good, and there is a surprising amount of bass! The speaker takes 3 AAA batteries, which I thought was a little bit strange. This is the only thing I've owned in a while that hasn't used AA's, or a rechargeable battery pack. I'm impressed though that after using this speaker for between 30 minutes and 3 hours per day for several weeks I haven't changed the batteries once! Overall a very good buy, and I would recommend this to anyone looking for a small portable speaker."
,,DGR,Surprisingly good sound!,08 Nov 2010,5.0 ,"I was skeptical that such a small enclosure would be able to produce enough bass to make the listening experience worthwhile. I read the other reviews and this speaker seemed to be the one to get in the price range. Well..... the masses were right! For an ultra portable speaker the sound is incredible. Don't get me wrong, it doesn't compare to a high end setup but for the price and size you really can't go wrong. Toss it in your travel bag and you're set! As for the negative comments that most people have made I'll have to agree. The aux connection cord is ridiculously short. The on/off button could be easier to operate and more prominently displayed. The bottom twist on/off cover that covers the batteries.... well if it breaks I wouldn't be overly surprised. That being said I highly recommend that you save yourself some wasted time researching other speakers and just click buy. IMHO it's a category no brainer. Great job Altec!"
,,Amazon Customer,Four Stars,31 Aug 2016,4.0 ,sounds good
,,NBS,Very good not great.,21 Apr 2011,4.0 ,"Almost great. It has everything you could want in a portable speaker. First, very portable, the carry case it comes with is form fitting and durable, connectivity is great with built in 3.5 mm plug, battery life seems good. The only reason it's not rated a 5 across the board is the most important reason SOUND. It's just good. I've had and heard better. You can't go wrong with this speaker, just don't expect to be blown away."
,,Lou Who,Great portable sound,09 Apr 2009,5.0 ,"Small, lightweight with great sound. I've used this speaker to listen to my MP3 player and my laptop and both sounded great. You have to be aware that the volume is controlled by the audio source (MP3 player, laptop in my case), so if the sound quality is distorted at high volume on your audio source then the speaker sound will be distorted, too. I advise you to set your audio source on half volume with the speaker connected, and increase it if necessary. The speaker will be louder and of much better sound quality than your audio source, but it will distort if your audio source is turned too high. Is it going to sound like a high quality sound system with a subwoofer? Uh no, but it's great to listen to your portable devices in a contained area like the same room, the next room, on a patio. The design of the speaker is very well done with the connecting cable wrapping around the recessed bottom for easy storage. The included case is perfect for protecting the speaker. The only wish I have to improve on the speaker is to make the cable that connects the speaker to the audio source longer."
,,bookreader,DO NOT BUT THIS SPEAKER - Burned out in two weeks,12 Sep 2012,1.0 ,"I bought this speaker so I could have good music on the go through my phone. I have a Motorola Atrix, and the program I use is Poweramp. When I got this speaker, I followed the directions perfectly (make sure no EQ settings are in use, and turn device volume to 85%-90%). At first, I was happy with the speaker, but then I noticed some slight static sound coming from it when I played music. I didn't think much of it until today, when the speaker completely blew out and is now unusable at higher volumes. This speaker absolutely does not do what it's advertised to do (for more than two weeks, anyway), so I can't recommend it to anyone under any circumstances."
,,Michael Kiley,Five Stars,22 Jul 2016,5.0 ,It worked OK and use it for small enclosed spaces. Mike
,,S. MARKS,Sounds Great,14 Dec 2011,5.0 ,I bought this speaker knowing that Altec Lansing always makes a good product after I returned one of the off brand rechargeables. It's easy to swap out batteries (I bought some recargeable that last for hours). No crazy charging/hookup/usb cords like some others. This is the one you want. Just plug it into your device with it's self contained cord and enjoy it.
,,Doug Williams,I,19 Jan 2015,5.0 ,"This has got to be one of my most prudent purchases!! It works well with all my stuff ranging from MP3 player to my laptop. I am very pleased with this Altec Lansing iM-237 Orbit speaker, it is truly a modern marvel!!!"
,,Bob,Love it,13 Sep 2012,4.0 ,"Just what I needed for use with iPod or when I want a better speaker to use with my laptop. Sound is good, not perfect, but for the money I am well satisfied. The only thing that would make it better would be if it had a rechargeable battery. That is a minor issue and certainly not a deal breaker. I would recommend buying this speaker."
,,ancphat,A perfect little speaker for iPod,02 May 2009,5.0 ,"I bought this product based on the review I read online. And boy..I'm not disappointed at all! It's so true as advertised that it's a ""Mighty Little Speaker""! I used it with my Nano iPod. So far this is the third speaker I tried/used with my iPod and it's the best. The sound is very clear and crisp. I can take it anywhere and everywhere. I use it to listen to music in the kitchen, bedroom and even bathroom. The only downside is the switch on/off at the bottom. It's very small and difficult to push. I had to use the tip of my pinkie finger. All that said I still highly recommend this product!"
,,D. Cole,Amazing little speaker,28 Dec 2009,5.0 ,"I bought this from amazon after hearing one of these that was purchased from our local ATT Phone store for nearly twice the price. Good volume and sound quality for such a small enclosure. For those having trouble stuffing it into it's carrying case, take the clear plastic band off the circumference of the speaker and it will slip right in.I paid $19.95 for this speaker. I don't know what happened to the price but I recomend you check different sites for a better price!"
,,Amazon Customer,Sounds great; good price,14 Feb 2010,5.0 ,"After all the positive reviews my expectations were fairly high, and I was not disappointed. -- Together with an radio app on my iPhone, this makes a great portable Internet radio; consider it as an alternative to a Squeezebox. -- The sound quality is more than adequate for streaming and holds up well enough at high volume to fill a small room. -- A longer audio cable would have been nice."
,,Bryan,Pretty good for a small speaker!!,14 Aug 2013,4.0 ,I Got it on time but not in the original packaging from the Amazon Warehouse. Portable with a 3.5 adapter. Lasts long with brand new batteries about 10-12hrs that why I got it. Not that loud but produces quality sound. Plastic material makes it light and it has a nice carrying case. Like I said not that loud for the beach and you cant play anything with to much bass or you will get distortion. I would recommend it for a small gathering in quiet surroundings it has a strap as well so it can hang off anything. I would've liked it to be much louder but hey its not a boom box.
,,millertime,great portable speaker,29 Jun 2011,5.0 ,"I was impressed with the sound the came out of this speaker. It is very compact, very portable and seems constructed well too. My only complaint is the hard wired adapter that plugs into the mp3 player, the wire seems thin. I hope this does not become an issue. However, I felt no need to give it less than 5 stars. Altec makes good products!"
,,DR,"Works Well at Moderate Volume, Not So Well at High Volume",19 Jun 2013,3.0 ,"Got this to plug into my Razr Max smartphone to use on a multi-person teleconference situation with significant background noise. Worked adequately so that everyone could hear much better than with phone speaker alone, which wouldn't have worked very well, but at anything beyond about 3/4 volume it did start to rattle and distort. Short cord wasn't a problem in this instance, but it is really short. Battery compartment top is pretty darn poor, so plan on treating it with care. One set of alkaline batteries lasted better part of two days work (16 hours)."
,,AJ Nito,super volume,18 May 2014,5.0 ,"Excellent accessory for phones, laptops or tablets. The sound is loud enough and have that ""bass"" pop. Do not expect this to sound like Bose or like Harman-Kardon. The cable is a little bit short, but you can buy an extension/adapter from RadioShack."
,,Eduardo Hidalgo,Excelente producto,25 Dec 2009,5.0 ,"Es un producto de excelente calidad, tanto en su sonido como en el material en que esta construido. Esta bocina se pueden llevar en su maletas, maletines de viajes y cuando este en un lugar tranquilo solo conectar su MP3 player y podra disfrutar de su buena musica. Lo recomiendo por su precio y calidad. Lo negativo es que no tiene control de volumen, este esta controlado por su MP3 player."
,,Mystery Fan,WAY better. The old speakers were very tinny,10 Nov 2014,4.0 ,"compared it to an old pair of portable mini speakers.....WAY better. The old speakers were very tinny. This little AL speaker is no boombox, but it has a fairly decent sound especially for it's size and portability...and price."
,,skskumar,Good Quality..But doesn't last 5 days,25 Mar 2012,1.0 ,"I bought this speaker mainly to use in my iPhone 4 and laptops. sometime the youtube videos has very little sound. Initially it worked ok and gave very rich sound compare to its size. I mainly bought this speaker based on the number of reviews in amazon. Generally I trust the Amazon reviews and buy many items purely based on the reviews and user experiences. This speaker died down by itself after 5 days. I hardly used this 5 times. This doesn't work anymore and of no use. I had complete trust on the amazon reviews but after experiencing this product I am bit skeptical. I completely wasted by 23 bucks. I would have donated that amount to charity rather spending on this crap product which didn't even last 5 days. Bottom line, The quality of sound was good but how does it matter if it doesn't last enough to get the return on the investment."
,,Kathy,Love my little speaker...,06 Jan 2012,5.0 ,"I have a droid and use the speaker mainly to listen to audio books on tape. Its nice to have the flexibility to not only use in the car, but to take with me other places. I'm on my second Altec speaker....my fault. Don't carry around by phone with speaker hanging from cord attached to phone (I caught it in something and pulled). Use it a click or two down from maximum volume for very clear listening."
,,Audrey Fountain,Best little speaker ever!,22 Jul 2015,5.0 ,"This little speaker packs a big punch! I've taken it hiking, camping, traveling in foreign countries, and I hook up to the imac at home. It's awesome and the sound is still fantastic years later."
,,Larry W. Hagood,Great like the original but with a much better switch.,03 Mar 2009,5.0 ,"I had the previous model, while it sounded great and the batteries lasted forever, the on/off switch was horrible! I couldn't believe that this thing was passed around a board room and got the thumbs up from the execs at Altec Lansing with that stupid ring switch. The new model not only has a normal on/off button but also has a the power indicator / low battery light. I did A/B comparisons between the old and the new, they do sound slightly different but I could not decide which one sounded better. I think the older model hit the highs better and the new one hits the lows better."
,,Mama Miller,David Beats Goliath!,13 Nov 2009,5.0 ,"I wasn't really expecting much when I made this purchase, but I was pleasantly surprised! I can't speak to the 'connectivity over time' since I haven't had it that long, but everything else is spot on. I originally bought this item for my iPod Touch 2nd Generation to use at a Baby Shower I was hosting. It was a last minute purchase and the most important aspect to me was price. There was no way I was going to spend hundreds of dollars on something I was probably only going to use once. But when it came time for the shower, I never even used my speaker. So, I brought it home and placed it in the kitchen and cranked up some tunes while I was cooking and cleaning. I had it on for hours and it never faltered. This little giant puts out some great sound! I've used it for hours and days and I haven't had to change the batteries yet. Now I'm no techie, but this little speaker is great for the 'average Joe'. It's simple, sleek, small and portable. And it works! I give it 5 stars and 2 thumbs up! Thanks Altec!"
,,A. Duffin,Perfect for the Price,01 Feb 2010,5.0 ,"I love to cook and I often find myself in the kitchen wishing that I had some music to keep me company while my hubby is watching TV in the living room...this was the perfect solution. It's small enough that it doesn't take up any counter space...the sound quality is good enough for what the product is. It's not a BOSE speaker but it's good enough for the price. I love it so much I can't wait to take it to the pool, beach, picnics and all my travels! What I love most is that I don't have to take my iPhone cover off to plug it in...Great little portable speaker!!!"
,,J,NOT AS GOOD AS I THOUGHT it would be,04 Jun 2012,3.0 ,"I bought this because of the positive reviews but found the quality less than I expected. It distorts at full volume on some tracks and isn't as loud, clear or bassy as I had hoped. Also it takes batteries which is a bit of a pain. I had seen the ihome version which doesnt take batteries and is smaller but went for this one. kinda wish i had gone for the ihome one. This is not a side by side review how ever and it could be that the sound quality is better than the ihome. I think the reality is these little speakers will be nothing like decent speakers so if you after something small and portable go for the ihome version."
,,Karina Gomez,Glad I bought it!,18 Sep 2012,4.0 ,"I was pleasantly surprised with the sound of this little thing. It packs a punch. I carry it with me from room to room although I mainly bought it for the bathroom. It's not so loud that you could use it to host a party or anything, except maybe as background music during dinner or something, but for listening to some tunes in the shower, while getting ready for work/school or sorting laundry it's perfect. One note of caution, the batteries run out crazy fast, especially if you accidentally leave it on (guilty!). I would definitely invest in the rechargeable batteries and charger Amazon suggests."
,,Rick H.,"nice sounding speaker, small and lightweight..",27 Jun 2009,4.0 ,"This speaker is great for travel or a day on the beach when you don't want to bring along a heavier unit for your Ipod or phone. The sound quality is good for such a small unit. But not great. At higher volume levels you get serious distortion. And of course, not much lower end. But, overall I like it. I can take with me when I'm bicycling and not have to wear headphones. It would be great on the beach too."
,,RL.Robertson,"Nice sound, but distorts at full volume",13 Feb 2012,4.0 ,"Overall I am impressed, it definitely puts out more sound than I expected it to being small. At full volume on my phone, it seems to distort slightly.. I turn it down though and it sounds really good. Battery life has been good so far. I usually just have it in the window sill playing during showers, and it has been going on the same batteries for over a month."
,,Jonah,This is one of the best portable speaker iv'e gotten!!!,11 Sep 2013,5.0 ,"At first i was pleased at how it was packed. It was in a smaller box inside of a bigger box that had giant airpacks to reduce any movement. Then when i opened the smaller box it was packed very tightly and neatly with bubble wrap and instructions. The package came with all that it said it would the speaker, a cover for it, a sling to hang it to things, a converter from a 3.5mm to a 2.5mm, and 3 AAA batteries The only thing i probably hate is how it got delivered. As i saw the mailman about to drop off the package he threw it up the stairs. Which i was angry about. But all in all a very great portable speaker!!! Is worth your money!!!!"
,,BlaineCC,Exceelent small speaker,29 Apr 2012,5.0 ,"I bought this so my family could sing along to the numerous Christian worship songs that have been made into slide shows with lyrics on YouTube. I use my tablet to play the slide show and this little speaker plays beautifully. I have a very nice stereo system but the portability of the speaker makes it the preferred way without sacrificing sound quality too much. We can even sit around the kitchen table and worship God. When you are trying to be consistent with leading your family, you need things that make it easy as well as enjoyable. As someone who is very picky about sound quality (and not just thumping bass) I highly recommend this little speaker."
,,K. Graff,Amazing sound quality for a little thing and low price,23 Aug 2009,5.0 ,"I travel frequently and wanted to listen to quality music/movies/etc. instead of just through my horrible laptop speakers. After reading quite a few reviews on portable speakers, I chose Altec Lansing's iM-237 and have been extremely pleased. The sound quality is very good, but is relatively excellent given the price. If I happen to leave this behind one day, oh well, I'll drop another $30. I even bought a 2nd unit recently for my wife to listen to Pandora via her blackberry at the office. Highly recommended."
,,slo,Quite impressive!,06 Dec 2011,5.0 ,"As a former concert promoter and a self professed audiophile I find this little speaker to be above and beyond Altec Lansings description. I am a remodel contractor currently and was looking for a sound system that was less bulky than typical job-site boxes. Waiting to see if battery life claims are accurate but the sound quality is impressive. Does not rock the whole job site but is great for the rooms I work in. Also fits in the water bottle cage on my bicycles. Highly recommended to anyone looking for awesome, portable, and easy to tote tunes. I feel like I should buy another just 'cause..."
,,Stanton,Do you need a portable speaker?,08 Sep 2014,5.0 ,"This is a great product. Great sound reproduction and I love the portability. I can take it outside when grilling, in the bathroom when showering, or in the garage when I'm working. If you're looking for a portable speaker, look no further."
,,A. Machado,Great product at a great price!,21 Jul 2011,4.0 ,"I bought this speaker based on the various customer reviews and I have to say that I am impressed. About the only negative thing about this product was the first device i received. it was working perfectly and about 2 weeks in it stopped working all of a sudden. I replaced the batteries and messed with it a little and nothing. However, i placed a claim and they shipped me a replacement speaker within 2 days!!! i was extremely excited with the seller's prompt response. I have since had the 2nd speaker for over a month and have had no problem. i've even taken it to the beach and everyone was very amazed at the sound this little device delivers.. i would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for an inexpensive alternative to a portable speaker!!!"
,,Laird Young,Best $20 I Could've Spent,07 Dec 2011,5.0 ,"I was looking for a small portable speaker to use in my partner's hospital room. I already own 3 Stereo docks from 3 different manufacturers, all of which I like for different applications. In this case I wanted the best sounding super-mini I could find, and at a price I could live with if I rarely used it in the future. After reading other Amazon buyers reviews, including one Saint who did a comparison of several on my list, I chose the Altec iM227. I couldn't be happier with it. It sounds great FOR WHAT IT IS, which ISN'T a stereo dock, and the battery life is going on 12 hours or so from the initial set of 3AAAs and still going strong."
,,Dave in Utah,great little speaker,17 Mar 2012,5.0 ,"Bought this to listen to ipod in car- music, books, etc. Works well- not as good as if I could get it to come through car speakers, but adequate. Also use it a lot at home to watch movies on laptop, listen to music or anything else on laptop, listed to ipod, etc. Very convenient. Good rich sound. Very happy with it. Bought a second one for my wife she liked it so much. Going to buy a third for our daughter. For $20, very happy with it. Used it fairly regularly for 2 months before having to change battery the first time."
,,R G,"Loud, good sound, nice price",13 Sep 2012,5.0 ,"I've tried several powered and un-powered stereo speakers in this price range. This is louder than any of the others (maybe it is easier to do with a single mono speaker). The quality of the sound is better than any except Sony (but the Sony wasn't loud enough); treble and bass frequencies come through OK. The size is small enough to easily carry with me when I travel. Only down side is that it takes 3 AAA batteries, which will need to be replaced occasionally. Also included an adapter for those tiny headphone jacks in some cell phones. Speaker also came with a wrist strap (that I'll never use for hanging from my wrist, but will use for hanging from a hook on the wall)"
,,rural girl,it's great! but the wire shorted out ...,27 Apr 2010,4.0 ,"I love this little speaker! It is small, the sound is great, I carry it around or put it near where I'm working and it has transformed my life a bit. The price is terrific! Hi - as careful as I was ... the wire shorted out and it just doesn't really work well anymore. I think it shorted out about a year after getting it ... so is it worth one year for $35? I don't know ..."
,,KS,Very cool little device,09 Jul 2010,4.0 ,"Lets face it.........this speaker is not going to replace a boom box on the beach during a huge cookout, but it is a perfect personal speaker that works and sounds great. So simple to set up and uses the iphone volume to get louder. Best part is that the perfectly molded case that acts as a nest for the speaker and directs sound where you want it. Iphone speakers are o.k. for what they are but this little speaker makes the iphone come alive."
,,kavlito,Impressive!,22 Dec 2009,5.0 ,"A friend had one of these and totally impressed me with the sound quality. Although it is not stereo, the intended portable use makes it a non-issue (as well as the incredible sound). Especially nice if you have a notebook or netbook, which notoriously have bad sound (except the Acer Aspire One), and need a bump up in sound quality, or would just like to share music or movies with others."
,,Subeedude,Altec Lansing iM227 Orbit MP3 Speaker,14 Jan 2012,4.0 ,"I purchased this speaker to use with my laptop. The sound and volume are five star, but the wire cord is only about six inches long making it cumbersome to work around. I have since purchased a speaker that mounts on a flex wire that inserts into a USB port and it does not have the function problem. Why the engineer would choose to use such a short length is difficult to ascertain."
,,JLWoodworx,Cheesy construction,07 Oct 2013,2.0 ,The sound is not bad for a $30 speaker. It will augment an iPad enough to listen to music in a small room. But the construction is cheap. The battery contacts are flimsy and need constant adjustment (bending). The on/off switch failed after a few months rendering the thing useless.
,,Maru,Great speaker,04 Jan 2013,5.0 ,"I'm glad I didn't purchase the newer USB powered Altec speaker because the USB version wouldn't work with my mp3 player or my phone since neither has a USB port to plug into that speaker. The original Orbit is superior since it can plug into anything that has a headphone jack outlet, and although I've dropped it several times while biking or at the beach...it still works perfectly."
,,Annette,Great product,14 May 2011,5.0 ,I found this item to be extremly easy to use and yet does everything I need it to. My son saw it and tried it out and he was very surprised with the sound quality and volume ability. He was a little disappointed that he could not get more base but overall he has enjoyed it as I have. In fact so much that I need to purchase another so I have it available when I want to use it. That says a lot as he is a very picky listener and critic. I highly reccommend this product.
,,jmb711,Three Stars,31 Jan 2016,3.0 ,"If you need a little speaker, this works well."
,,Judy,Love it!,30 Jan 2010,5.0 ,"Great little speaker! It was difficult finding a speaker for my Sansa Fuze, since most of the speakers are made for docking the Ipod only. I haven't had it long enough to determine the battery life, but so far it is still working well. I like being able to move it around easily, and that I will be able to use it out by the pool during the summer. The sound is great, and plenty loud enough. The case does push the button on when trying to close it, so I just won't use it unless traveling. Then I will take the batteries out to avoid it. If you turn the button towards the back part of the case, where the zipper is not directly on it, you can keep it from turning it on, though."
,,Texas Daddy,Huge sound in the size of a baseball,11 Jul 2011,5.0 ,"Great sound from such a small speaker (relatively speaking). I also purchased a Zenex zn-sp5512 2.1 tube speaker for $15, and this one has much better bass, plus clearer highs and mids. Great little case with a lanyard to hook to your belt loop. Works unbelievably well with my phone, and now I don't have to lug around a big jam box anymore to have great sound."
,,DC,Nice Speaker Overall,21 Jun 2013,4.0 ,"The speaker itself is quite good overall but I want others to know that the item they are buying my not be a retail package. To some this may not matter but to me I was a bit shocked as I got one for someone as a gift. And as a gift its nice to have full retail packaging and graphics. I will do a quick review to compare the IM-237. The unit is almost identical to my IMT-228 the 228 has a more modern color with black and orange that looks pretty slick, while the 237 has a gray and silver body, BOTH COME WITH CASES. The differences I note are in construction the 237 uses what appears to be an aluminum speaker mount, TOP BODY, where the 228 has a plastic speaker mount, now this may be what makes them sound slightly different due to the materials each is built around. I feel that the 237 has just a little bit solider bottom end but not a lot. They both sound quite clear and defined for the size of the driver, although the driver is no bigger then what most clock radios have in them, This does not in any way sound like a cheep clock radio speaker as one may expect. It actualy has nice clear shimmering highs with pretty good bottom and excellent vocal quality, again for its size it is quite impressive in my opinion. My reason for adding my review with the following info, is based on the fact I also own a IMT-228 that did come in full retail packaging from a different seller also fulfilled by Amazon. The item I purchased did appear to be brand new but only came in a uline corrugated shipping box not with full retail packaging. Nowhere do I see it mentioned that this is a warehouse type deal and does not come in full retail packaging. Note to Amazon please verify that if a seller fulfilled by Amazon is selling the item without full retail packaging, I feel this should be noted. I see no mention of that at this point. Again if it's a gift one may care about this, if not I am sure most will be fine ... it does come with the case, batteries and everything it should. I hope this will help others decide what Orbit to buy :-)"
,,HighExpectations,Stopped working within 60 days,22 Jul 2013,1.0 ,"Should have known not buying from Amazon.com directly would be a bad idea. Item broke within a month and cannot contact seller for an exchange. Item worked well while it did (used it only in my bedroom for a cell phone speaker for music). I can hear something broken rattling around inside and if i move the speaker even slightly the power light goes off and the sound with it. I am not the only customer with this complaint. Buyer beware. Very disappointed in the product and ""DEALPROS""."
,,Reviewer,So far so good,27 Nov 2008,4.0 ,"I was looking for a small portable, lightweight, alkaline battery-powered speaker I could easily toss into a suitcase and take on travel to play in hotel rooms when I didn't want to wear headphones, and also have something to play at work occasionally. After looking at a few different portable speakers I settled on this given the price, size and favorable ratings of its predecessor and the trustworthiness of the brand name. I was pretty surprised at how clear, crisp and sharp the vocals sounded on practically every ""reference"" song I tried it out on, even at higher volumes. I actually think its a good deal crisper than my Bose on this score, and certainly better than my JBL sound stage. Driven up to the highest volume there is transistor-like distortion, and some distortion at lower volumes in songs with more bass. On most songs played at low to medium-high volume levels (tested on rock, alternative, pop, classical for the most part) it nicely filled my home office and I could hear it loud and clear from the first floor, and I expect it will perform just as well at work if not better, as I can't turn it up nearly as loud there as I do at home. I am knocking off a star because the battery compartment door does not snap shut and tends to fall off at the slightest nudge. If there's a secret to making it stay on I don't know it - there were no instructions included with this intuitive plug and play unit, and really none needed. Others might find the lack of an iPod dock and short cord to be an issue; these didn't concern me. I found the sound quality to be better when I propped the unit up on an angle - nearly standing up straight - inside the carrying case. For the price, if you're just looking for something lightweight and small to fill a small to medium size room with pretty good quality sound with little distortion, the Altec Lansing Orbit is a good bet."
,,Ron J. Highet,Five Stars,26 Mar 2016,5.0 ,works awesome use it on SB-7 voice box
,,Mark A in Atlanta,Cool little speaker,17 May 2012,4.0 ,I wanted something I can carry around and use with my smartphone. I am pleased with sound and it is a lot better then the built in Sprint EVO speaker..Haven't had it long enough to see how long the batteries last. First unit broke after 1 day but amazon sent a replacement overnight and this unit hasn't had any issues.
,,J. Furuglyas,Better Than Expected,02 May 2011,5.0 ,"For the size, ease of use and the $$$, this is a great little speaker. I use it at my desk at work. It provides good sound and is super easy to use. Just plug and play! Some are complaining that the sound is not what they expected. I don't know what they are expecting. This is not a Bose Sounddock. It is a 5 inch diameter, single speaker that delivers what is intended; local sound for your mp3 player. If you want to fill a room with sound, do not buy this speaker. You can turn it up and hear your music in a small office setting. Too much ambient noise will drown it out, unless you are nearby. But as I said, that is what it is made for. My colleague was impressed by the sound from this little cylinder! Well worth the price."
,,James Battle,Key design flaws ruin a potentially excellent product,30 Mar 2012,1.0 ,"PROS: The sound quality of the speaker at moderate volume is excellent. It is aesthetically pleasing and takes up very little space. The unit feels solid and doesn't slip. CONS: Pretty much everything else - The 1/8"" stereo cord broke after about 1 month of use. The VERY SHORT cord winds around the bottom of the unit and then pops into a fitted slot. There is a 90-degree bend right where the jack attaches to the cord. This started coming apart right away. The speaker distorts anything you plug into it if at maximum volume. The instructions do warn you to turn it down to 80%, but this means that it's not loud enough to make out news reports while you're in the shower, for instance. Mid and high tones distort during loud passages, especially with classical music. Battery compartment case is difficult to remove/replace. You have to do this often as it sucks through the batteries pretty quickly. I changed the batteries at least twice weekly. It died and will not power on after 6 months of use. I bought the SimplyVibe SV-X6U1-Black Rechargeable FM, MP3 Player and Portable Speakers w/ DSP Bass for iPad 2, iPod, iPhone 4S, Laptops (Mac/ PC) and Mobile Devices (Li-Ion Battery) - Accepts USB Drives and SD Cards to replace it and am surprised this unit sounds better, has USB power option, reads SD cards, and has an FM radio tuner, just to name a few features."
,,Mark S. Ellison,Works well!,03 Jan 2013,5.0 ,"This speaker gets lots of use in our house. It is frequently used by my daughter to share the music on her ipod with others in the family. We also use it to increase the volume of my Dell computer, so that it can be heard throughout the familyroom/kitchen area. A couple of my children use it to listen jointly to books on tape, while they do crafts, too."
,,Charles J. Sewell,Just right for books on tape,30 Jan 2010,5.0 ,"I bought this for my wife, who uses it to listen to books from [...] on an iPod. She didn't feel safe wearing ear buds while she was driving. Good adapters to play the iPod through the cars radio were too expensive and a bit complicated. Sound quality is great at the volume level she needs and with rechargeable batteries very cheap to maintain. Pros: good quality, simple solution to listening to books on tape. Cons: takes 3 AAA batteries and my battery charger can only charge 2 batteries at a time. Would be great if unit would charge batteries in place with a USB style car adapter."
,,Contact Approach,Great little speaker,13 Mar 2013,5.0 ,"When I am on the road, I sometimes watch netflix movies on my laptop in the hotel. However, my laptop has crappy speakers. At times I have given up on watching a movie because I was missing too much due to the poor quality of sound from the laptop. This little speaker solved the problem. I also use it for listening to talk radio over the computer. It seems to burn through the batteries pretty fast though. After two or three movies and a few hours of radio the little LED light starts flashing red. But after it starts flashing red, I can still get another couple of hours before it goes dead."
,,Irish Step Dad,As advertized,04 Feb 2011,4.0 ,"I have been looking for a portable external speaker that my daughter can attach to her MP3 player so she can practice irish step dancing when we are on the road. She bought a couple of cheap speakers before, but the volume and sound quality were lacking. We are not audiophiles, but we wanted something better. This speaker fits the bill perfectly. It does not break the bank, but the quality is far superior to the other products that we have seen. The volume and the clarity are surprisingly good from such a small package. This is not a bookshelf speaker. This is not a high fidelity external sound system for your computer. But if you are looking for a very portable speaker I am not sure that you will find anything better."
,,damon,Easy to blow out speaker,04 Jul 2013,3.0 ,"The Good: This speaker has a durable design and can be tossed into a bag or backpack without worrying about it. The sound it produces is good not great, with decent bass response for its size and price. It has a handy lanyard cord and the mini-jack cord can wrap up in the bottom of the speak, out of the way. The Bad: Speaker blew after a couple months, now its scratchy when the volume is around 80%. Overall: It's good while it last, but this little guy can only party so hard."
,,Stephanie Moyer,6 months later and I still love it.,10 Dec 2012,5.0 ,"Well, I'm assuming it's been about 6 months. Seems that long. I've had this thing since the beginning of summer. In replacement of my car stereo, it's not thaaaaat great. For a tiny speaker that fits in my little change catch, I love it. Has pretty good sound and I wouldn't mind using this thing for a computer speaker. It doesn't take up that much power. I can use the same ever ready batteries in it for a month or so and still have enough in there for maybe 2 more weeks. It doesn't sound tiny to me, and the voices sound clear. Very good for the price."
,,D Battista,short life span,31 Jul 2011,2.0 ,"I ordered this speaker to go with my mp3 player for portability by the pool. The battery life was way too short,and it only worked for a short while,just long enough for the return time to expire. The volume had to be turned all the way up to get any kind of sound quality,and even then there was a lot of static. I did like the portability and case that came with it. I would rather have invested in a more expensive portable unit with quality sound."
,,BellNBanjo,"A great-sounding, durable speaker with case",14 Nov 2013,5.0 ,"I like this speaker so much, and it has such great sound that I bought another one. I was careless and damaged the cord on the first one, that I had had for three or four years. It is well-made and not fragile, the damage was my fault. They come with a very nice padded case."
,,JohnBee,As Good As a Small Speaker Can Sound!,30 Dec 2010,5.0 ,"This little gem sets a benchmark for how good a tiny speaker can sound. It provides a huge improvement in listening for laptop, smartphone and iPod-type users, making it possible to get enjoyable sound without headphones or earbuds. Despite a couple of reviews to the contrary, I found the sound quality to be both loud and clear, with surprisingly good base response. A couple of minor gripes: The power button is recessed in a small hole, making it somewhat difficult to easily turn the unit on and off. Also, making the connecting cord a bit longer would be a nice touch. So.. wow! It doesn't often happen that a product exceeds my expectations, but the tiny Altec Lansing iM-237 Orbit speaker has pleasantly surprised me."
,,anthony frye,"like to return it,",09 Apr 2014,2.0 ,"the speaker is still on the same page with ghost tool i thought this was a ghost box,,yeah i know i over looked or miss understand what i got.it was just a speaker.why would i even want it,the GHOST BOX looks a little like this spearker GHOST BOX,not sure i know what to even use it for,i got speakers on tv computer radio..lol dam..waste of money,"
,,M. defelice,incredible little speaker,19 Apr 2009,5.0 ,"After about a month of using this speaker, I am IMPRESSED. It has a sound quality which is great for its size. Quality is good even at high volume. Batteries (I use rechargeable) last many hours. I have no con's. I love it, because with my little mp3 player, I can have music anywhere, without headphones, and easily carry both in one hand. I've already been recommending it to others. Works with anything with a regular headphone jack. Rugged. Nice little case. I use it at home, and even in the car (don't have a car radio)."
,,T. JORGENSON,"Cheap and effective, Altec Lansing is a good choice no matter what $ level you choose.",04 May 2014,5.0 ,"Cheap and effective. For better sound the newer iterations of these are a better choice, but you get what you pay for. These are loud, effective and entirely worth the money. You'd spend $50 or so for better ones, tho."
,,Jeff Bartelli,Great little speaker,10 Oct 2012,5.0 ,"After looking at the highest rated portable speakers on Amazon I chose this one because it did not have internal rechargeable batteries. Too many people complained about the batteries going dead after a year with little support from the manufacturers. This speaker won't have that problem. Plus I bought it with some rechargeable batteries, avoiding the problems of the other speakers. The sound quality is great and the speaker seems durable and reliable. I would recommend this (or the newer model) over the competition."
,,MK,Well worth the price,21 Jul 2010,4.0 ,"I've been looking for a portable speaker for my iPod for a long time, and had been leaning toward some of the larger, more expensive docks/speakers before deciding to give this one a shot, based on price and reviews. I'm glad I took the chance because this is a really nice little speaker, with clear, balanced sound and good battery life. It also fits the headphone port of my Mac laptop, which is great because the speakers on the laptop aren't very high output. I now use this speaker in my bedroom and on my balcony, and will be bringing it along when I travel. Minor cons: the cord is way too short (had to get an extender), and you can't turn the volume past about 75% before the sound gets tinny. The latter is more of an observation than an issue, because 75% is plenty loud enough."
,,grateful music maven,Excellent for my purposes,02 Jan 2012,5.0 ,"I frequently share discussion podcasts with a conversation group. This speaker has high quality sound with reasonable volume and works very well for this purpose. As expected, it is not stereo. It appears to be reasonably sturdy. It's a bit large to fit in one's pocket, but sound quality and volume make up for that. I'm very satisfied."
,,ex-jerseygirl,Okay and then poof! dead.,19 Oct 2015,3.0 ,"Originally had this at 4 stars but downgraded it because the speaker blew out after a while. I primarily listen to the radio and podcasts so it's not like I was blasting heavy metal through it! Left it at 3 stars because, prior to that, it was useful for that type of listening."
,,KathyS,Terrific Sound!,28 Nov 2011,5.0 ,"As an ipod shuffle owner, I don't have many speakers to choose from. This one has fantastic sound! I have only owned it since last month (October 2011), so it waits to be seen how long it will be good. I hope it lasts for a long time, but for the price, if it lasts a year, I'll be thrilled. If it conks out before then, I'll be changing my review, but at the moment, definite 5-stars. Terrific sound, great portability, and it's nice and small. Perfect!"
,,Michel A. Gaudini,Thank You Again Altec Lansing !,06 Jul 2011,5.0 ,"Just got it today and I must say that, for such a small speaker the sound is VERY good. Of course it does not compare to the big hifi speakers but I was so desesperate to find some speakers for my Ipod Shuffle (the Shuffle cannot be plugged to any Ipods boomboxes because ....there is no connector on it). I used to own an Ipod Nano and I wanted to consider getting a Bose speaker but I read a comment from a customer raving about Altec Lansing ( price, quality and lots of bass too) so I bought one model that i would still have if I was not broken into :-( On my Shuffle I have been putting only music from the Sixties so the sounds fits perfect. The included case makes it safe , the price is great so I guess I got some good stuff without breaking the bank !!"
,,"eat 1st, ask ?? later",cheap solution for isimple,30 May 2009,5.0 ,"I bought this speaker to avoid tearing my dash apart to install isimple to play my ipod in my truck. For the price, it's a wonderful solution. Tone quality is very good, and build quality is impressive. Having been warned in previous reviews about short wire, I bought an extension which works well. I highly recommend this product - I also use it on my netbook with good results."
,,mom | business owner,My review,26 Mar 2012,4.0 ,"I needed a speaker for my barnes and noble nook color. This is a perfect size and the sound is great. We use it for movies with the kids or listening to books/music. My only issue so far is that the cord is very short. It can be awkward if not sitting at a table to rest the unit on. Overall, still a great product."
,,Insimps,Great sound for such tiny speaker,30 Jun 2014,3.0 ,This is a great little speaker. So cheap and SO loud!! And tiny too! I stole one from my husband so I bought this to replace it and my son ended up taking it! We love it!
,,Paul Deyoung,Great,15 Oct 2009,5.0 ,"I read the product information carefully as well as many of the reviews. As a result I was well prepared in terms of what to expect and I was not disappointed. The speaker works very well, is light and highly portable and provides great sound given its size. If I could change anything I would add another 6"" to the connecting cable but that is not a major issue. The sound is excellent and I can crank it up so as to be able to hear it when I am working on various projects or simply reading wherever I find a moment."
,,El Rae,great small portable speaker,03 Aug 2010,5.0 ,"I didn't realize how small this speaker was before I received it. It packs a punch and is so easy to bring anywhere. works well with a laptop as well as an ipod. Great little speaker and the 3 AAA batteries seem to last quite a while. I am very happy with my purchase. Word of warning, turn down what ever device you are amplifying before turning on the speaker, then adjust volume on the device. there is no volume control on the speaker."
,,ChristopherWLindsay,Have spare batteries on hand,21 Dec 2009,3.0 ,"I've had this speaker for about two months. I use it for listening to my mp3 player that has podcasts. The vocal intelligibility is fine, but I would not use this for playing music. The battery life in the instruction guide says about 20 hours. You can double that, but the quality of vocal intelligibility gradually gets worse. A red light that stays on for awhile will tell you when the battery life is getting low. The connector that plugs into the MP3 player is vulnerable to over-use. (the cable right above the connector is worn, and the sleeve has come off). So you'll want to minimize extra handling. For what I use it for, it's fine and worth the money. But if this is a solution for something you plan on using a lot, then you may want to spend a few more dollars for better technology and design."
,,344,frustration,04 Oct 2010,3.0 ,"The sound quality is excellent for the size, but I do not see a lot of difference with the Altec Lansing Orbit MP excepted for the price. They are both poor in design functionality. The battery case in The Altec Lansing iM 237 frustrating to close and expected to brake soon. The speaker was sent without the original box, could it be defective? a good product, poor design, poor retail."
,,Andrew Meadows,I attached this to my bike and hook my phone up to it!,30 Oct 2013,5.0 ,Love this little speaker! I attached it to my bike rack and run a cord to my smart phone which sits on my handlebars. I love biking and bumping some tunes. Speaker sounds great especially for the price. Light drizzle has not affected the speaker but I do remove it during hard rain (if I get caught out there).
,,Amazon Customer,Amazing! Pleasantly surprising!,26 Jan 2011,5.0 ,"Ok, I was a little bit skeptic about this speaker and based my purchase on everyone's reviews. I've just received it in the mail and it was packaged perfectly. It was nestled in its case and when I put the batteries in and turned it on, I was nervous. But then the music started playing and the sound is amazing for a little speaker. I always fear on a small speaker that the sound will be too much treble and not enough base but that's not the case. However, if you're the type of person that likes ALOT of base, then this isn't for you. But for someone like me, it's perfect. I bought it to use at work and it's small enough that I can place it in front of my computer, set the volume and enjoy. You won't be disappointed with this product, I know I'm not and would definately buy again!"
,,Travis Warner,Powerful Speaker,03 Sep 2015,4.0 ,Iowa Paranormal Investigators paired this up with our PSB-7 Spirit Box. It is a powerful speaker. I love how it runs on batteries because the other speakers I have are only rechargeable and don't last that long at all. The only thing I wish they would do is add an Optional Rechargeable feature AND a Volume Control Knob on it. That is the only reason why I didn't give this 5 Stars.
,,D. Monroe,Great sound from a small device,29 Dec 2011,5.0 ,"This speaker is about the size of an orange, and sounded great when connected to my Android phone or iPod Touch. I didn't know what to expect, but it sounds great and gets loud if you need it to via your device's volume control. The battery life seems long too which is good, after using it for several days now."
,,S. Bittante,Cool but the case misses the mark,03 Dec 2009,4.0 ,"I bought this speaker because I needed something that can handle quite a bit of volumn without distortion. It's great for that. The size is good BUT the case that came with it is such a tight fit that it is really difficult to get on. You have to flip the zipper casing into an odd position and pulllllllllllllllllllllllllll it over the speaker. I'm worried that it is so tight it will press down on the power button and wear out the batteries. So now if I'm going to put it in it's case I remove one of the batteries. Not convenient, since there is no outside pocket on the case for extra batteries or to slip your mp3 player into... that would have been a better option. Also the cover on the back is a bit tricky to manuver. But that's just the learning curve of the device. All in all it's a nice little gadget."
,,J. Floriano,Best bang for your buck....,20 Mar 2012,5.0 ,"I was looking for a small inexpensive speaker to replace my no-name $10 swap meet special I got many years ago. this speaker is plenty loud. not much bass, but that's to be expected from such a small speaker. I like the fact it takes batteries so I can use rechargeable batteries and don't have to rely on plugging it in to charge."
,,Jana,"Cute, portable, simple, sounds amazing",13 Nov 2010,5.0 ,"I've had this little thing for a year and I still love it. I usually use it with my iPod to listen to podcasts, but music sounds great on it too. It's got incredible sound for such a small speaker! It's very efficient as well, the batteries last a long time, in fact I haven't had to change them yet. The only problem I have is sometimes I forget to turn it off...oops. It could use a longer cord, as others have said, but I haven't really had an issue with that. It would be neat to have it in other colors too, but the steel gray goes with everything so I can't complain. If you have been disappointed in the sound quality of portable speakers, try this one."
,,DRU2012,Rockin' li'l speaker,15 May 2012,5.0 ,"I had heard an older one of the these attached to someone's phone at the park last summer, so I already had enough of an idea of what it sounded like to want one myself--but this one exceeded all expectations. What can I tell you? I have more than 150 of my favorite tunes available, along with Pandora , Tune In and all the rest, and as rock guy, smooth bass and ringing highs and mid-range are required--and amazingly THERE with this little wonder. It's not a studio monitor, obviously, but on a picnic table or a blanket you'd have to spend a LOT more cash and lug something substantially more bulky to really beat it. As it is, I throw it in a pocket of my pack whenever I head out now--""just in case""."
,,ANA,Good speaker,09 Dec 2009,3.0 ,"I've been using this speaker for almost a year now. Great battery life! I use it for about 5/6 hrs in a month, and so far I haven't had to change batteries... although now the red button comes on now (instead of green) so I'm sure i need to do it soon. Speaker is good for what I'm looking for. At high volume sound gets little distorted sometimes. I don't expect home stereo quality from tiny speaker.. it does its job very well and I'm happy with the purchase."
,,licensed2kill,Defective,02 Mar 2012,3.0 ,"Received the speaker today it was defective from factory. For some reason they left out 2 out of 6 battery contacts! That is not a minor oversight, have to wonder about their quality control. Amazon won't exchange it so I have to return and reorder, will give it another try. Update June 2012: Have bought 2 of these speakers since the first order. They produce good clear sound, no issues, am glad I reordered."
,,Chad E. Desjardins,Surprisingly full bodied sound,16 Jul 2010,4.0 ,"I purchased this product for a kayak camping trip. Portability/Compatibility and battery life were the primary concerns. The unit itself is surprisingly sturdy while being quite small (i.e., ~2""tx2.5""w). Nevertheless, it sounded bigger. Some more ""bassy"" hip-hop didn't sound great, but performance for acoustics/rock genres surpassed my expectations. The 3 AAA Batteries outlasted the 3-day trip, which made me feel foolish for lugging around an 18-pack of replacements. Note that the phone jack wire is only a few inches long. This wasn't a problem for me (plugging into an iPhone), but I can imagine some situations where cord length would be an issue."
,,loveshorses,Happy with the product,24 Dec 2010,5.0 ,"When I found this item and read the reviews, I was afraid to order this for my 19 year old son and 30 year old nephew. Some of the reviews stated that the sound was too low and not a good sound. Well, I took the plunge and ordered two of them anyway. Now, I'm so happy I did. When my 19 year old opened this gift he was excited. Then he put the batteries in, which came with the product, and turned it on. Wow. The smile on his face said it all. He said, ""Listen to this. I never would have thought that it would be so loud and sound so good."" For a 19 year old to say that, it has to be good. My nephew loved his just as much. I bought these for them to use when they go horseback riding. We just got them, so I am not sure how they will hold up. Hopefully, they will be able to enjoy them for a long time to come."
,,Amazon Customer,Okay Speaker!!,08 Jan 2012,2.0 ,This is a really good portable speaker and it is good for on the run travel. I would of given it a five star but after a while the speaker started to make that disruptive cracked sound speakers give off when it needs to be replaced. The quality of sound seems to diminish after a while.
,,Aaron,Great product. A couple extra features to add?,08 Jun 2011,4.0 ,"For the size and simplicity, this is a great speaker. It's better than any inexpensive computer speakers I've had. Sound is loud and clear. I wish it had an auto-off feature as I like to have it on the night stand as I'm falling asleep, but it doesn't seem to be a battery hog either. I've fallen asleep with it on several times and it gets a lot of use out of one set of batteries. I also wish the carrying case had room for the L plug and an extension cable since the cable is pretty short. A little kickstand to angle the speaker would be great too, but that's just being picky. I do think the price point would be a little more reasonable in the $15-$18 range, but I feel like I got my money's worth."
,,Sandi,This little thing 'ROCKS',14 Jan 2013,5.0 ,OK - this little thing is freaking amazing. I used it to play music from my phone and no one in the room could believe it came from this little tiny speaker. My grand daughter blows the doors off the room with it. My husband bought one - after hearing it I ran AMAZON and bought 2. I would recommend it to anyone who wants good sound.
,,C. Montejo,Excellent,05 Oct 2010,5.0 ,"Except for sound quality, which is VERY GOOD, I rated this device as a 5 (excellent) in every category. We have a large family with a demanding baby who loves music; we carry it everywhere we go, most notabley in the stroller on my walks through rain and shine. It's so easy and it seems to last forever without replacing the batteries."
,,jensi,Small and efficient,01 Apr 2009,5.0 ,"I have been looking for a speaker system that could work with my MP3 player (Sandisk Sansa) and my laptop for over a year. Among other features I was looking for were portability and sound quality. I bought this one and used it in a 2-car garage sized hall for a birthday party and the guests were impressed! They kept asking what the speaker was. Sound quality is very good and volume, even at the maximum was also good. I'm glad I waited this long to find exactly what I wanted."
,,Darsden,Music Beats,21 Feb 2013,5.0 ,Got this for my lil ipod for riding in the boat and it is perfect. Have a lil troller set up on my blow up dingy and now I have my tunes blasting for all to here. Great clarity with this lil speaker I will be adding another one to run at the other end :-) happy happy
,,chelle2906,Altec Lansing Speaker,19 Dec 2013,4.0 ,"This Altec Lansing speaker is a pretty good little speaker. Like any other small speaker, it has its limits so its not meant to be the party animal. I use this speaker for bath time in the winter....tunes out the outside noise :)"
,,A Happy Consumer,A lot of boom for such a small box,04 Jun 2013,5.0 ,"We use this with our phones, laptop, and spirit box. It has excellent range and packs more bass than you'd think in such a tiny speaker. It conveniently has an on and off switch and is easily portable. You won't go wrong with this amazing little speaker."
,,The Rick Man,Great unit!,08 Dec 2012,5.0 ,I use this to listen to audio books on my Kindle and the speaker has great sound for it's size. Also i have used it on my Zune to listen to audio books and it really works great and the sound on the Zune with this speaker is amazing! I have not tried it with music. Rick
,,Michael J. Troutner,Killer,30 Jul 2011,5.0 ,"This thing works great - the sound is quality - one way you can tell is to just look at the speaker moving - most little speakers don't have the physical movement that indicates a good bass response, this does. Real nice, worth the money (we take it to the beach, etc. and it's perfect for discreet and decent sound.)"
,,Goldfish,"First I thought it was a fantastic product, but after a month it started buzzing ...",17 Apr 2015,1.0 ,"First I thought it was a fantastic product, but after a month it started buzzing and Produced a lot of static. I returned it for a refund and ordered something else."
,,Young Animal,Disappointed with Altec Lansing,09 May 2012,3.0 ,"This speaker works very well for about a month then it breaks. The first one i owned stopped working after being dropped on the floor, while it was in the case, and the second one stopped working for no reason. Battery life is okay but not that great, maybe about four hour of medium volume use. I would not recommend this product because they break for no apparent reason, even if not dropped."
,,wj,"Load, Powerful, Clear Sound",17 Jul 2013,5.0 ,Purchased for a family member as a gift. This little speaker is great. It's capable of playing loud and clear. Can't beat this speaker as far as size and price go. In my opinion it's an alternative to purchasing a dock. It's been in use for years around the house.
,,Ben,Altec Lansing iM227 Orbit MP3 Speaker,04 Jul 2012,5.0 ,"All I can say is that these speakers are spectacular! WOW! They produce a great sound, whether you're listening to classical or hip hop, these speakers deliver. During rap and hip hop songs, the speakers bring out the bass, but not too much and not too little, which is just right. I listen to these while I am showering and the sound quality is still great. I would highly recommend music enthusiasts to purchase this awesome speaker!"
,,Michael,Useless after a few hours of use.,24 Oct 2015,1.0 ,I was only able to get a few hours of use out of it. It soon began to spontaneously turn off its power light and produce a high pitched scream.
,,Jesse,One Star,01 Jan 2018,1.0 ,What's with the price of $129?
,,Mrs Lee,It does its job,08 Jul 2013,4.0 ,"Purchased it to plug into my phone so I could listen to audiobooks in the car during my commute. It works, but isn't loud enough to let me hear well over the car noises. So I purchased earphones and will use this for something else not in the car."
,,Timmp,Great Portable Speaker,22 Apr 2009,5.0 ,"This is a great portable speaker, self powered so it doesn't drain the battery in your player. I use it with my Nokia phone, and it completely fills the garage, the back porch, the barn, or a conference room with music. On my phone, it even does very well as the speaker/Microphone for hands free if you wish a conference call. Great Buy, Great Product."
,,Sylvia Arceyuth,Awesome for Office Music,19 Sep 2011,5.0 ,"sound Quality was beyond what i expected, It's really handy if you want to hear music on your office. I take it with me to the office every day and I have my music playing during my whole 10-hour shift, first battery replacement was after 3 weeks working from Monday to Friday, That's Amazing I recommend this speaker if you are not comfortable with headphones or don't like to to use your phone's, iPod's, MP3's Speaker to listen to music at work or home. I love It!!!"
,,Cheeto,Would buy another one :),11 Jul 2014,5.0 ,These are great portable speakers! They sound great with the right amount of bass. Other than you can't recharge this like other speakers and have to use 3 triple A batteries it's still a great speaker.
,,Marie,... of these speakers for many years and was very pleased. When this speaker wore out and quit,12 Oct 2014,1.0 ,"I had one of these speakers for many years and was very pleased. When this speaker wore out and quit, I ordered this speaker to replace it. After 2 months, it quit working. It was past Amazon warranty. When I tried to contact Altech, I got a message saying that the website had been disabled. When I finally was able to get ahold of someone at Altech, I was told that they don't handle these small time items. They said that all they have is the phone number that I used earlier. Nevertheless I am not a happy camper."
,,Backyard Birder,Great little portable speaker,08 Jul 2011,4.0 ,"This is a great little battery powered speaker. For its size and price, it provides great sound. I have a larger Altec Lansing iPod speaker that has better sound, but needed a smaller more portable speaker. This one comes with a handy case and is small enough to fit in a bike pack or a purse."
,,John Lichtenberg,The Altec Lansing speaker was the right product for my needs.,17 Apr 2013,5.0 ,"I wanted a small portable speaker to use with my iPhone while traveling. I like the fact that this product had a battery that was easily replaced. Other products had a built-in battery that could fail causing the speaker to also fail. The sound is much better than the small speaker in the iPhone or iPad and the volume is more than I personally need. For the money it's a great buy for anyone who likes to listen to Pandora, NPR or any other program away from home."
,,Tim,Five Stars,24 Mar 2017,5.0 ,good
,,Wayne,There's better speakers for your money.,01 Feb 2014,2.0 ,"Check out the Philips Sound Shooters, for a much better sound! This only plays in mono, which basically ruins most music. I dropped it and it the top part caved in a bit. Much better speakers for your money out there, don't buy this."
,,J. Boice,Decent little speaker,06 Feb 2014,4.0 ,"Decent purchase, I wish the cord was longer and that I had splurged on the rechargable one. Battery life is @ 6 hours depending on the batteries you use. If you wnat one, email me and I will sell it to you for $5!!"
,,Fascinatingbooks,Great little speaker!,12 Oct 2011,5.0 ,"Great little speaker for use with anything you can plug headphones or earbuds into. Very good sound quality but not super loud. Easy to put in batteries and energy saving button to turn off when not in use. Useful green light shows when speaker is ""on"". All in all, fine for those times when you want to listen to a tape or even the Kindle and want better sound than the speakers provided."
,,CBD,Almost perfect on-the-go speaker,18 Sep 2010,4.0 ,"Bought this speaker to use with a lap top, a portable DVD player and an IPod. Works great with all. Use this when camping when we have no electric, so a battery model is perfect. Sound is excellent for such a small speaker. Have only had it for a short time so I can't comment on battery life or how it will hold up over time. Only flaw is a very short connection cable."
,,James E Brinker,... many years ago and it is still putting out great sound.,07 Jun 2016,5.0 ,Bought this many years ago and it is still putting out great sound.
,,Sherry,Stopped Working After a Few Months,03 Jun 2013,1.0 ,I really liked these speakers until it just stopped working. I was playing my music like usual then in the middle of an awesome song it just stopped playing... no screeching sound or anything. It just stopped. I thought maybe the batteries died so I replaced them and the speakers still didn't turn on. I probably won't buy these again... not worth my money. PROS: Good sound quality for a small speaker Nice portable size CONS: Stopped working after a few months Battery case doesn't keep batteries in
,,T Harrison,Great little speaker--BIG sound!,30 Nov 2013,5.0 ,"This little speaker is amazing! The sound is awesome, and the batteries last seemingly forever. I love its portability without the loss of quality. I have recommended this to my friends, and they have bought it--also very happy."
,,busyactonmom,awesome,18 May 2012,5.0 ,"This makes a HUGE difference in the sound and how loud you can make your IPhone's volume. I needed this for a small party at an outdoor location and it seems like it will work great so that the people in our party will be able to hear the music but not disturb the other patrons. It is slightly larger than I thought but not enough to be a bad thing, it is still quite small for a portable speaker and I can just throw it in my purse with no problems. I like the fact that it takes batteries so I don't have to worry about having to charge it with my computer. Hopefully at the actual event it will be perfect."
,,Terrorsteel Blackson,Good wearable speaker,17 Jul 2012,5.0 ,"Background: This is my solution to my work's ban on headphones. They want us to be able to hear emergency alarms and incoming work machines, thus don't want our ears plugged up. I've searched Amazon at length for a portable speaker I could wear at a reasonable cost. The iM-237 and included case (with some modifications) was the best product for that. Most things I take into work will eventually die from abuse, so I've replaced this speaker three times. - The first purchase lasted 5 months and cost $28.29, bought March 2010. - Second one lasted 9 months, cost $23.57 in August 2010. Both times the failure was cord damage, from being yanked on by metal railing I work around. - The third purchase and the one that has just died lasted 14 months and cost $17.25 in May of 2011. This time the speaker itself has had something jarred inside and is failing to produce sound unless sat a certain way or I bang it around some. I do not blame the manufacturer for the device no longer working. I just wish someone would make a wearable, ""jog-proof"" alternative. Set-up: The carabiner clip is a great idea, but the clip itself is crap. I threaded a key-ring through the hole and clipped a more robust carabiner to it. I wear the Orbit by threading my belt through another carabiner clip, then clip the case on. This allows me to easily take it on and off as desired. I took a pair of fabric scissors and cut open a hole where the Altec logo is, just big enough for the actual speaker on the Orbit. I have played the speaker through the fabric, but it muffles the sound. Now I punch a hole in the bottom back. I place an extension cord inside and connect to the speaker there. Why? As noted before, I yank on this cord a lot, so it is cheaper to replace an extension cable than the whole speaker. I wind the excess cord around another carabiner clipped to the key-ring. I attach the extension to my iPod Touch and put the Touch in my back pocket. Pros: - Lossless sound as far as I can tell. Loud with good bass. It's why I keep re-buying. - Many people seem to prefer a rechargeable speaker to this one that requires batteries. I find it better to have a spare set of AAAs in my pocket than wait for or be tethered to a wall socket charger. - This case keeps it snug and portable and is the main reason I've bought this speaker. Cons: - Obviously, the Orbit isn't quite rugged enough for the paces I put it through. Perhaps Altec should take this review as a hint. - The carabiner clip has no spring and is very loose. The speaker isn't very portable if it detaches and falls to the ground, is it? - The thickness of the cable length and where it meets the connector are an issue of longevity. Conclusion: I do love this speaker. But I will NOT be buying another one at the current $41-46 price tag. Nor the IMT227 OrbitM for $35 or iM227 for $30 (which may actually be the same product). It does not mean it would be a bad purchase for you. I just can't personally justify the cost given how often I replace them. Right now, considering the iHome iHM60LT Rechargeable Mini Speaker at $20 and just putting it into the Orbit case (with some newspaper filler or something, as the iHome is smaller than the Orbit). I'll wait a while to see if the price drops down to =/< $20."
,,Munda9021,Altec Lansing iM227 Orbit MP3 Speaker,23 May 2013,5.0 ,Went on a cruise with my wife. These speakers are really well made and good to have. Only one thing is the battery lid is not to easy to open. Other than that I highly recommend the device. great sound. Great bang for the buck!!
,,Zenacity,It might be nice if it worked.,05 Jun 2015,1.0 ,Stopped working. This company used to stand for quality. Now it's pushing junk. Soon after purchase the power switch quit working.
,,Christopher M. Underwood,"Great sound, some drawbacks however",17 May 2012,4.0 ,"First off, it works very well so I am giving it 4 stars. However, the cord is a tad short which other reviewers have said. Secondly, it does distort if you run it at the 80%-90% level as suggested for optimal volume. BUT, it sounds awesome. I have been able to compare it to the iHome version that accordions open. The biggest reason I went this route was the fact it WASN'T rechargeable. I am not always at a place with USB to charge it as the iHome requires. So, I can throw in an extra set of batteries while camping etc. and have tunes. Overall I am happy with this item and I do plan on keeping it at this point."
,,Love to Cook,GREAT item,20 Dec 2009,5.0 ,"I could not be more pleased with this item. I bought it for myself, and for my two daughters. I wanted to try it out before I gave it to them as a gift. I teach, and take my IPOD to school while I work, but I worry about having headphones in, since it makes it hard to hear the fire alarms. So this seemed like a great solution. The sound (for me) was excellent, and I find I'm taking it in my car as well. I love the case. To be honest, when I first tried to get it out of the package it shot across the room and bounced off the dishwasher, and it's just find- I can't even find a scratch- so I assume it must be pretty robust (or I was very lucky). My daughters dislike sharing earbuds with people to share music, so I think this will be a find item for them, plus it's just fun."
,,Norm Follosco Jr.,best small speaker i've purchased to date,02 May 2012,5.0 ,"This item is absolutely amazing, I received compliments on the loudness and clarity of such a small speaker the very first day testing it out shooting hoop @ the park. Many we're deceived on where the music was coming from thinking it might have been someone's backyard blasting the music but they were unaware it came from the small unit sitting behind the basketball hoop. Probably the last external speaker I'll purchase for my mp3 player 'til this one breaks or stops working which I highly doubt b/c altec lansing backs their products with quality craftsmanship, design, and functionality. If you want a small, portable yet powerful music speaker this is the one to get hands down."
,,ceceland,Pretty good,29 Aug 2011,3.0 ,"This speaker is inexpensive enough and you get what you pay for. I chose it for casual travel because it uses batteries. (I use recyclable and rechargeable batteries.) The other small speakers charged using USB. I wanted a speaker for around pools, beach, camping when a USB is not an option. The sound is ok, not impressive. There is no volume control on speaker. It is very light. Cord wraps up neatly. It did not come with a bag. It serves it purpose and the quality is what you'd expect for low price."
,,Amazon Customer,good little speaker,11 Nov 2013,4.0 ,"Nice speaker. This is my families 4th speaker, all have been dependable and perfect for what we need. We like the idea of replaceable batteries, and how long they last. You're not going to get phenomenal, booming sound, but that's not what we bought them for. Well worth the money."
,,Jake,A little trouble,21 Jan 2013,4.0 ,I bought this speaker about 9 months ago and it is still working and have only had to change the batteries once. When I first bought the speaker it worked fine for about a week then it started to get interference when I picked it up to change a song. This continued for a couple of weeks and the only way to fix it was to hold the wire while it was playing. I was frustrated and about to return it but just forgot about it. After I picked it up again the problem has totally gone away and it has played perfectly since. The wire is very short but other than that the sound gets pretty loud and its affordable.
,,Luna,Vary nice while the cord lasted,23 Jun 2013,4.0 ,"Even though there was no volume control, I enjoyed this ultra portable little speaker for quite awhile - until the inevitable happened and it stopped working because of the cord. Would haved been so happy if the cord had been detachable so I could just replace it but that's not possible."
,,Angela Bull,Great little speaker,02 Jun 2013,4.0 ,"I often need to boost the sound on my iPad when watching movies. This little speaker is just the thing. My cons are trivial, the round shape makes it tricky to set in place sometimes. It's not indestructible. The springs that hold in the batteries can become compressed after repeated droppings so that you have to pry them up to make contact. After a few pries they will break."
,,Eljjohnson789,Awesome sound from a small speaker,21 Jul 2011,5.0 ,"I bought this speaker to have one that I could carry around with me but would be plenty loud. It is WAY louder than I expected! The sound is great and competes with my iHome alarm clock which is 3-4 times larger, you simply cant turn it all the way up or it gets distorted. But 90% is still plenty loud and good quality. The bass is good but doesn't compare well with the rest of the sound, but its still more than you would expect from such a small speaker. This speaker does NOT have a volume control. I like that feature on speakers but volume needs to be changed on the iPod. Other than that its an AWESOME speaker, well worth the money."
,,SoLo,Quality Speaker,11 Aug 2011,4.0 ,"I like its size and sound Quality, it's not too high but still is good for listening to music or watching movies. I bought it so I can watch movies on my tablet Downside is that its cable I find short and would've been on the plus side if they had lengthened it abit. Although this speaker operates on Batteries I went for it because of what I hear of other speakers having issues with the adapter to fail after a while, I think its better to have seperate batteries running it. Adjusting volume is through your device connected to and not by the speaker itself. Overall you feel its a Quality product and would recommend it alongside getting a cord extenstion"
,,Blank Drew,Works Great with Samsung Netbook,01 Nov 2010,4.0 ,"Nice sound in a compact package. Not going to rattle your windows but it is 20x better than the built in speakers on my Samsung N130. If your travelling and need something to make watching Netflix or Youtube more enjoyable it's great. Can't comment on battery life as I haven't ran the ones it came with down yet, gonna see how it lasts on an upcoming vacation. Had to reduce the volume output on the netbook to about 50% to reduce distortion. The plug was a little hard to get in all the way, maybe because my netbook is new, but once I got it seated properly, it was fine. No regrets here so far!"
,,jaybird,Mighty Little Speaker,29 Sep 2009,5.0 ,while shopping for a portable speaker for my MP3 player i read alot of online reviews. It became obvious to me that the Orbit 237 was the choice of many reviewers who liked not only the sound quality but also the price. I was amazed at the sound generated by the Orbit. This portable speaker is a heck of a buy.
,,ajw,Good sound and value,01 Jan 2013,5.0 ,"I was wary about buying this product, but needed something for ""on the go"" sound. This works well for my iphone and even on my desktop pc when needed. The speaker cord is a little short for operating on a pc, but otherwise great product and great sound!"
,,HJ,Great sound and nice packaging,09 Jun 2011,5.0 ,I just received the speaker today and tried it with various devices and netbook which don't have good sound. Wow this speaker is a way better than I expected. Its packaging looks expensive and build quality is great. The sound is loud and clear. I recommend thid to everyone.
,,D. Stimson,Great sound for the bucks!,17 Jun 2011,5.0 ,"Well I rarely review anything I buy, but have to say this little speaker is great! Using with Ipad2 and Iphone4. Plugs in easily and is ready to go.Good bass, middle and treble at about 3/4 volume. The sound is certainly more than enough to enjoy music and movies so far. Construction appears adequate, and the carrying case should protect well. Ultra portable and works great in my office at work. Cannot beat the price here on Amazon. I challenge anyone to find a better sound for the $20.88 price. I have not had the speakers for long, so I cannot speak for the longetivity, but have no reason to believe it won't continue to work. I am certainly glad I made the purchase."
,,3tech,"Work well, great sound",20 Jan 2013,5.0 ,"I use this little speaker on my work laptop as I never know what to expect when I travel to do presentation work. I have used this in a meeting room that seats 12 to 15 people and everyone can hear, loud and clear. Small and packs easily too."
,,Jennifer H.,Altec Lansing MP3 speaker,31 May 2012,5.0 ,"This is great sound for such a little speaker. It's hard to tell it's mono and not stereo. It's loud enough that I can hear it while playing my acoustic guitar. I plug my Ipod in and play along and not drown it out. I also use it while grilling outside. Fiends and family are amazed at how good it sounds. It's worth the money. The only complaint I have is that the cable is permanently attached and is only 6 inches long. The cable should be detachable and longer. Other than that, it's perfect for what I use it for."
,,TJParkinson,Altec Portable Speaker,13 Mar 2012,4.0 ,"Sound Quality Acceptable on the ""distorted"" side,because it's always on full blast, having No Volume control. It's a little inconvenient having to adjust the volume on your phone or device. It's loud enough for small areas (in the car or a small room) Sturdy construction and built to last, no case included. If I hadn't bought it online without trying it first, I might not have purchased this speaker. I would have spent more money for better quality sound w/volume control. Since I already bought it, I'll keep it and use it, being satisfied that I paid a reasonable price."
,,Daniel Knoblich,Altec Lansing Orbit Speaker,10 Dec 2012,4.0 ,"This product met all our expectations. We were looking for something to plug into our Mp3 player while we were walking with the stroller. This puts out great sound, and the volume is more than adequate to listen to."
,,IRENSKA,it works well,21 Dec 2013,5.0 ,bought this for my grand daughters 7' portable dvd player which had very low sound even at the highest setting. now with this speaker she doesn't shush us anymore and can hear her movies much better.
,,MGK,Exactly what we needed,13 Sep 2010,4.0 ,This product performed exactly as advertised and was what we needed for a driving trip with a bunch of pre-teens and teens who want to sing along or listen to their own selection of music instead of what the radio has playing. It is great to be able to keep an MP3 portable while still sharing the music. Very satisfied.
,,Jared Leibowitz,eh...,25 Jul 2015,2.0 ,sounds started distorting after a few months
,,Krazy Kat Lady,Impressive sound,26 Feb 2010,5.0 ,"After reading reviews of many types of smaller speakers, I chose the ALTEC LANSING iM237 - and I AM GLAD I DID! I am a bit of a snob when it comes to sound, and the sound that comes from this tiny speaker is excellent. I use it on my desk at work, and sometimes it's so loud, I don't hear people walking into my office... unfortunately... for them, if they catch me singing along! I recommend laying it on it's side with the speaker facing you. And remember if you are using it with an iPod Touch that you can adjust the Music Settings EQ - and sometimes you have to vary it by song type. PLUS - I find the carrying case so cute! It's an adorable speaker! Cuter than cats!"
,,Robert Lackore,Decent little speaker.,15 Dec 2011,4.0 ,"Nice and portable. Works well with my mp3 player, though sometimes the cord seems a bit too short. The sound projects well and, to my unsophisticated ear, isn't overly distorted or tinny. I like to listen to audiobooks while trying to fall asleep; I can set the volume to a low level and still clearly understand the spoken word, even when the narrator has a soft or baritone voice. The construction seems solid, not too heavy or too light. The power button is recessed and very small - it can be difficult to press with fat fingers. Overall, I'm pleased with my purchase."
,,Silomi,Exceptional little speaker,23 Feb 2011,5.0 ,"You won't find a better speaker this portable. Ounce for ounce, this speaker packs quite a punch. I had to give a brief video presentation to a group of 40 people and my larger speakers wouldn't reach the outlet. I pulled out my iM-237 Orbit and it did the trick (with everyone being quiet of course!). The only downside I can think of is that it takes 3 batteries. I use recharchables (eneloop- highly recommended) and it's a bit annoying to have that awkward number. Otherwise no complaints. I've had this speaker for 3 years- taken it around the world under harsh environments and it still works great. Wonderful battery life too!"
,,John,Nice lil' Speaker,31 Mar 2013,5.0 ,"Transaction was smooth, and delivered on time, great service. As for the speaker, it was just a little bit bigger than i though it would be ( its about 3in wide x 1.5in tall ), but dont get me wrong its still a small speaker, and as for sound, this lil guy can pump the jams. it gets pretty loud for a speaker of its size, def louder than most of the other similar speakers ive seen. But just because its louder dont think that'll conflict with the quality of the sound because, at any given volume, this thing maintains a nice rich sound with good, but not overwhelming, bass. Hope this review helps!"
,,Dan Greene,Works well - I like it,06 Apr 2011,4.0 ,Speaker is solid sounding. I use it or listening to audio books so I am very happy with the quality. The size and shape are good and its pretty easy to carry around if I move to another room. I've used about three other portable speaker brands and I'm happy with this one the most. I had an Audiosource that was good but it was heavier and bulkier than this one. One thing I would like to see improved is the default wire - it should be a bit more rugged and a bit longer. I use a cable extender to lengthen the cable connection so I can manipulate my MP3 player without hving to worry about jerking the speaker around.
,,T. M.,Stopped working after three uses!,29 Mar 2015,1.0 ,I only used this product three times when it stopped working. All I get now is screeching sounds when I plug it in. Very disappointed!
,,Rob NY,Great little speaker,08 Dec 2011,5.0 ,"I like the sound, compact size and power on indicator light. Has a nice solid feel to it. I use it on my HP Touchpad and Android cellphone. Only downside would have liked it just a bit louder, but it's fine as is. I made this purchase based on another user's uploaded video."
,,Good Friday,GREAT SPEAKERS,01 Apr 2011,5.0 ,"Upon receiving my Altec Lansing iM-237 speakers I plugged them into my ipad and listened to some music. I am very impressed by the quality of sound. I also tried using a police scanner app on the ipad. The sound quality was awesome. You could hear these speakers four houses down the block. The only problem is that the cable is to short. I had to buy an extension cable from Best Buy. Now they are perfect. Next, I am going to plug these speakers into a portable CB radio and try them in the car. Bottom line. I highly recommend these Altec Lansing speakers."
,,JR,Nice mini travel speaker,02 Jan 2012,4.0 ,"Overall this is a nice little travel speaker. Compact, lightweight, rugged. It is about the size of two small cans of tuna stacked on top of each other. It has a short cord (about 8 inches) and runs on 3 AAA batteries. I bought it primarily to listen to talk radio from my Android device when I'm out on the porch or when I'm stuck in some hotel room. For talk radio, it is great, but music might be a little bit of a stretch. Music sounds fine - but it doesn't have enough low end response to wow you, but I would say it sounds better than most hotel room clock radios."
,,Ryan Sutherland,Solid Travel Speaker,30 Nov 2009,4.0 ,"Solid travel speaker for portable music players. I'm a big fan of its size and ease of use. Sound quality is not amazing, but for a speaker this size it is very good when new batteries are in it. Haven't had a chance to run the batteries for an extended period of time, so can't speak to battery duration or sound quality later on. The case is nice, my only complaint is that it is extremely tight around the speaker and I feel like it might bump the Power Switch thereby draining all my batteries. Also, no place to store replacement AAA batteries, but I guess that's part of the downfall of being so portable. Would highly recommend if you want something you can easily move around with and get sound."
,,Daniel G. Murray,This is a piece of junk,05 Jul 2012,1.0 ,"I've purchased (2) of these speakers over the past year and really like the portability and sound for the money. However, both units stopped working in less than 6 months. I therefore feel that the product isn't worth purchasing. They are apparently not built in a way that even provides 1-years of reliable service."
,,Opus22,Total surprise on how well it works!,19 Nov 2011,5.0 ,"Total surprise on how good it sounds. Much better and fuller sound than my laptop speakers. While compact, not particularly small - makes me wonder if it could be significantly smaller package design - takes a bunch of room due to it's height.(2 inches) so does not really fit into my laptop case. As others have said the short chord(7 1/2 inches) keeps things close. I also use it on my Kindle 3 - really good sound. I wish there were some way to do selections on it however. Totally recommended for a compact speaker to use with small portable devices that really have no good external sound except through headphones."
,,Jason T,Great sound for a portable speaker,07 May 2010,4.0 ,"The speaker itself sounds great, deep bass, very robust. I accidentally had the volume all the way up and plugged it into my iPhone, and it was shockingly loud, yet still sounds good even at that volume. The only drawback (as others wrote) is the short cable to the music device. No clue why it is only 6 inches long, but you can buy cheap extensions for these on Amazon."
,,NY Prof,Amazing,01 Feb 2013,5.0 ,"My second purchase- the first was for myself, the second was a gift for a musician friend. Anyone who hears these things is amazed at the volume and the fidelity. It's as though they can't believe their ears. I benefit from others reviews of products I am interested in, and I think A-L has a real winner with this little device. The batteries last forever, it cranks out a heck of a sound, it's portable- great engineering all around in my opinion. I hope they don't mess it up, and companies with successful products are wont to do sometimes....."
,,Tranina M. Glover,I used this speaker for a theme hike of Baden ...,09 Aug 2014,5.0 ,"I used this speaker for a theme hike of Baden Powell, several years ago. It worked perfectly. I dressed up as a Lion and I played the video of The Lion Sleeps Tonight."
,,Craig,Incredible sound from such a cool speaker,22 May 2012,5.0 ,"I bought one of these to plug into my nook on vacation and was very impressed. This single speaker plays both channels of a stereo signal, and has very rich tones. Of course you will get distortion if you set your player volume to max and this is warned against in the manual. So if you avoid max setting you will still get a loud clean sound. The same batteries I installed are still running strong after 1 month. Fantastic speaker and a great value!!"
,,Kiki,AMAZING!! Look NO further..this is the one!!!!!,19 Apr 2011,5.0 ,"This little wonder is simply AMAZING!!!! It is exactly what I was looking for...i wanted to be able to listen to podcast from my shuffle in the kitchen while cooking dinner and in the bathroom while getting ready and this is PERFECT for that! Voices sound sharp and clear and while playing around with it found that it works really well hooked up to my laptop to listen to my itunes. I can see that this will go everywhere with me, super small and cute too. I'm gonna get one for all my family members for christmas. The price and Amazons free shipping made this well worth it. You will not be dissapointed!!"
,,AMW,Most Impressive Sound!,17 Oct 2012,4.0 ,"This version of the Altec Lansing Orbital Speaker is MOST IMPRESSIVE!! As an instructor, I've gotten great use out of this for videos and presentations! The sound quality is excellent! I've purchsed four of these and unfortunately one was defective (wouldn't switch on/off). Overall, I recommend this because its economical, space saving, and has excellent sound quality."
,,Sage Of The Wabash,Everyone Loves This Little Thing,23 Dec 2010,5.0 ,"I first discovered these little speakers in September of 2010. I Was looking for a good combo of small size, simplicity of operation, and good sound. I am happy to report that these Altec Lansing ""Orbits"" have it all working. I was at first suspicious of the fact that they combine both stereo channels into a single mono channel. However, there are a lot of small radios that use a single mono speaker. Trust me, you will not even notice. With Christmas approaching I kept reordering from Amazon 3 speakers at a time, until I had given one to almost everyone on my gift list this year."
,,Gary Heartsfield,"Great Sound ,Great Package",21 Feb 2009,5.0 ,Have tried quite a few speakers for ipod and Iphone. This is by far the best. Amazing sound in such a small package. Case is very handy to throw in suitcase. Batteries last very long. As mention before cable is a little short but I use a short extension cable. Bought my wife one after she kept taking mine.
,,JimSussREALTOR,good speaker but connection defective,12 Mar 2015,2.0 ,"It's a great speaker, but the connector comes apart exposing wires and I believe this is a manufacturers defect. This is the third speaker I've gotten from Altec Lansing and it breaks in the exact same place so I would not recommend this"
,,C. Ripper,A nice little speaker that gets the job done,30 Dec 2010,4.0 ,"This little speaker puts out a lot of sound. It is loud, but don't expect perfect audio quality, it's not made for that purpose. If you are looking for a portable, no frills speaker to plug in your MP3 player, iPhone, or, in my case, XM Radio then this speaker is perfect. I purchased it for my Dad so that he can take his XM Radio on his boat without a lot of hassle involved. It does have a very short cord for the the 3.5mm plug, roughly 10"". There is a power button but no volume control. I can't comment on the battery life yet, but I will edit this review if I find the battery life exceptional or terrible."
,,Erol Esen,Packs a Full Symphonic Room,21 Dec 2010,5.0 ,"I don't know how this thing is engineered, but it is engineered in a way that's hard to believe your ears when music starts to play. It's like the musicians and their instruments pop out of it and you're listening to live music. I bought another one for my daughter."
,,Amazon Customer,Broke after a few months,02 Dec 2013,2.0 ,"Batteries did not stay in until I taped them in place. It had great sound, but it broke after a few months and I don't remember dropping it or doing anything to harm it myself. It started with a high-pitched noise that randomly came on and off until it got to the point where the noise never went off...and so I chucked it. Disappointed."
,,Ivaluevalue,Great portable speaker for the price,16 Sep 2009,4.0 ,"I was not disappointed--great sound for such a small speaker and it even comes with a nice carrying case. Right now I have it in my office and use it with my iPod, and I can hear my music throughout the house. I would give it 5 stars if the cord were 4 or 5 inches longer (or more)--can't figure out why Altec Lansing used such a short one. Other than that, I love it--good price too!"
,,Lizy,"Great sound, cord is a little flimsy",10 Mar 2015,4.0 ,"Great sound, cord is a little flimsy, I have already had to repair it as it came apart near the part that plugs into the device."
,,M. Lee,Good sound for the size.,26 May 2014,5.0 ,I bought this primarily for camping as I wanted something I could bring extra betteries for. The sound is good for the size. Battery life is actually pretty decent depending on volume. One drawback is there is no way to plug in a power adapter if you wanted to also use it in a small space more permanently.
,,M. Woodhams,Wow,25 Mar 2009,5.0 ,I am really impressed by this little speaker. We are planning on buyiong some for gifts now. The quality is very good and I was surprised how loud it is. We bought this to work with an ipod for camping and outdoor hanging out so we didnt have to lug around a boombox if we wanted music. Get yourself some Eneloop rechargeable batteries and you will be good to go!
,,Michael S. Tucker II,Great Speaker,07 Feb 2010,5.0 ,"This is an awesome portable speaker for iPod or any other music player. It has pretty good battery life, (about 24 hours) and although it doesn't sound as good as a high end set of PC speakers, it blows away every other portable iPod speaker I have seen. What surprised me most was the fullness of the sound it produces. It doesn't have pounding bass, which wouldn't be expected from a speaker this size, but the sound is full and enjoyable. My only complaint is that the audio cord it comes with is very short. Also the cord looks very fragile, although I haven't had any problems with it yet. I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants a portable speaker for their iPod and doesn't want to sacrifice sound quality."
,,The Contingency Plan,Missing volume control,12 Aug 2014,4.0 ,Good speaker but would be even better with a volume control. I use this with a spirit box and volume adjustment on the speaker would really be nice.
,,outdoorben,"When you balance cost, features and sound, it's really good",15 Jun 2012,4.0 ,"I have a very picky ear. It drives me nuts to hear music come out of the built-in speaker on an iPod. That being said, this is the very best I could expect from a speaker its size and in its price-range. Does it compare to my 12-inch Boston Acoustics? Of course not. Does it compare to a basic car stereo? Of course not. However, it does sound a bit better than an SDI iHM10 (iHome) battery-powered MP3 pair of speakers that we purchased a while ago at Target for around the same price. Overall, I'm very happy with this for background music that is in line with reasonable expectations of price vs. performance."
,,TheTruth13,Outstanding Product & Value,09 Dec 2010,5.0 ,"The only potential negative (and I say ""potential"" negative) about this product is that the wire for the speaker jack is less than a foot long. That hasn't been a problem for me yet, but I can see how it could be. Sound is great for such a portable unit. The entire thing fits in the palm of my hand; probably doesn't weigh a pound. I'm glad I read other reviews and chose this product. It has only been a few days, but thus far a total thumbs up!"
,,C. Genberg,Great product!,24 Feb 2009,5.0 ,"We originally owned the prior version of this product and loved the performance and flexibility. We use it to bring music with us (and our ipod) wherever we go if it is the patio, backyard, picnic, vacations, etc. It is particularly useful with our baby, now toddler. The old one finally broke due to it's cumbersome on/off mechanism so we tried this new one and have not been disappointed. Great sound and battery life (we use rechargeables) and much easier on/off button with light so you don't forget it is on (unlike the old one). We highly recommend it."
,,Dachs,Excellent for the price,09 Jul 2013,4.0 ,"I was looking at the bubble. the speaker where you expand it to increase the bass, but i read reviews where this was a lame product. The Altec is a much better product for $4.00 more. I have had no problems with it and for $20,00 its definately worth it. Altec also has better speakers for more money if you want to blow the windshield out of your car but for the money the $20.00 is worth it,"
,,P. R.,"Good sound, but iffy construction",18 Jan 2013,4.0 ,"I have two of these speakers. The sound is great, and for the price, it's awesome. They're also very light, and the batteries don't need to be replaced very often. Only problem is that one of the speakers stopped working after a year."
,,Jason Wiles,Excellent Backpacking Speaker,06 Oct 2010,5.0 ,"I picked this up to carry out in the woods for a little nighttime mood music. Man the sound on this is really not bad at all. I had to turn down the volume out of fear of disturbing other campers a hundred meters away. Of course it doesn't sound like a set of nice computer speakers, it is freaking tiny. But for the size and weight it has a really pleasant, clean sound with just a hint of bass. Perfect for nighttime, campfire music. Don't set your expectations too high and you will be rewarded with a nice sounding, ultra-portable speaker for your phone. Can't comment on durability but it seems solid enough. I'll post an update should anything happen to it."
,,LW,good product,19 Jun 2014,4.0 ,"This works as advertised. I have it in my older model car, so that I can play music and baseball games from my phone while on long drives. It runs on AAA batteries. I use rechargables, and they last a really really long time. I have been using it for several years now, and it is still working great. Only complaint is very minor, but I wish it could go just a little bit louder at times."
,,CH in Seattle,better than expected for the size,25 Dec 2010,5.0 ,"I was skeptical that the mini speaker would be a good value. I had bought others in the past. It certainly should not be compared to a Bose, but for a little over $20 it is definitely the best I've purchased of the three in that price range."
,,Sleevy,"It is what it is! *""Average Product""*",06 Oct 2009,3.0 ,"Does it's job (for what it is). $$ is too high for audio quality. But this product really isn't about ""sound quality"", it's about having more ""volume"" for on the go listening....when you don't want to bring your stereo system when traveling or on a date in the park. Only a slight step up (sound quality) from my MacBook Pro's speakers, may be better for other PC's . Decent for iPod/MP3 players. I'd probably go w/ their older version (which you can get for $10) or another, less expensive ""porta-speaker"" if I had the chance to listen to the current orbit. Hope this helps! Be Well!"
,,Jeffrey M. Powell,Love it.,06 Sep 2014,5.0 ,"Everyone that hears tunes through this thing, is amazed! Glad I got it. Easy to transport, and great sound. Does use batteries up pretty fast."
,,Janet H. Sommers,Great buy for my purposes,28 Apr 2011,5.0 ,I bought this for travel and to hook my Walkman into at night when outlets are often unavailable. I like to listen to podcasts at night to help with insomnia. It has more than enough volume and battery life for my purposes and it's so compact it's perfect for my needs.
,,Dawsen,Love it!,11 Jun 2014,5.0 ,"I had one of these for years but the cord broke (my fault.) I bought two others to replace it, thinking that other companies' technology had caught up with the crisp clear sound from Altec Lansing. Bad choices. I returned them both and ordered another Altec Lansing. So good. Very clear sound. Good resonance that can fill a small room."
,,Elizabeth R.,My Kid Loves It,12 Jun 2013,5.0 ,I got this for my daughter who recently got an iTunes account and an iPod and loves being able to download her own music. She was thrilled. It was a fun Christmas present that she wasn't expecting.
,,Jkantuta,Great little speaker!,03 Aug 2011,5.0 ,"Pluses + Sounds great + Good battery life + Comes with case (pretty handy if you're placing this in bags, backpacks, etc.) + Good value Minuses - Needs batteries - Not the sleekest speaker you will find - No volume control on speaker The last minus is the one I thought would annoy me the most, but it hasn't been a problem. If I turn the sound up on my laptop or mp3 player, it's already loud enough -- and can get even louder. I would definitely recommend this speaker!"
,,Guy A. Edson,Very Good sound,03 May 2012,5.0 ,"Sitting in a hotel room now... there is an iHome twin speaker/alarm clock/iPhone docking station on the night stand. I compared the Altec with the iHome and the Altec is a better, fuller sound. This is a good speaker and very nice to travel with."
,,A. Watkins,The best and most unknown MP3 speaker,23 Jul 2013,5.0 ,"This is the most amazing MP3 / Computer speaker, and it's only about $25. It compares with others selling for $100-$200! You will rarely find it in stores. Why should they sell something so amazing when the public believes they have to pay a fortune to get a good speaker? This is the best and only speaker you need for your computer or MP3 player."
,,alice allen,I like it,02 Oct 2013,4.0 ,We order this speaker and used it the next night and were totally amazed at the sound quality …. The only problem we have with the speaker is the fact it does not have volume control… you can control the volume with a laptop or cell phone but we had this hooked to the spirit box and could not control the volume at all… I would defiantly recommend this product to anyone interested in purchasing a separate speaker. We were very happy with the length of time it took to receive from company.
,,Aaron,Great speaker!,14 Aug 2012,5.0 ,"I was impressed with this fairly small speaker. It works well, and has good volume, and can handle a reasonable amount of bass for an external speaker. I think it looks good design wise as well. It does not weigh much so you can hold it in your hand too, which is what I will do as I am using it for my paranormal research group (connected to a Spirit Box). The wire wraps around the bottom on the unit but inside a indented circle that goes around. I would recommend this to others."
,,Z. Li,Total failure after light usage,05 Feb 2012,1.0 ,"My orbit mp3 speaker mysteriously suddenly failed working after about 20 light, normal uses.... Otherwise, reasonable quality performance and an useful portable size... nothing amazing, but was worth it for the cheap price when it was working..."
,,Mr. Reviews in WI,Good bang for the buck,20 Nov 2010,4.0 ,"Is simple to use, but I would agree that the cord is too short. The sound is good, can fill an average room with music. I use it either when I am in the garage, or relaxing in a room, or on a counter top when I am in the shower. Overall a good value for the money."
,,M. Charthern,"More impressed, nice device",15 May 2009,3.0 ,"I initially gave this product three stars, but after some listening and comparison to a Bose Sound Dock station, I give it four stars. This little speaker has some heart. Initially I said that I wasn't blown away by the volume of sound, but I take that back. The volume of sound is very good. The size is still too big, but it's manageable. Overall the sound quality is very good; not excellent. I am not an audiophile, but the mid ranges for this speaker sounds much better then the Bose. Bass is adequate, and that's to be expected. It's a speaker, not a sub woofer. I would recommend this item for any situation where a portable speaker is needed, and you don't want to spend too much money on a nice system. When I say nice, I don't mean Bose. Bose is overpriced and has issues. If you got money to burn I recommend the Harman Kardon Go + Play Portable Speakers System."
,,jwolf,Three Stars,30 Nov 2014,3.0 ,Great sound but huge pain to constantly be switching out battery.
,,Jay Mac,amazing sound and tough,17 Jul 2009,5.0 ,I have had this little speaker for about 5 months now and it is amazing. The sound that comes out is so much bigger and clearer than the speaker portrays. I use it at work everyday. It is small enouph to travel everywhere and I have banged it around and it can take it. A great companion. I am able to have my music while I walk around at work or wherever I am in need of tunidge.
,,Thomas G. Orr lll,"Good deal for hanging ""out"".",22 Aug 2014,5.0 ,Good sound from a very small source. Replaceable batteries available anywhere. Great for fixing meals around camp where plugging a device into a computer is decidedly no an option..
,,Russ,Great product,08 Jun 2009,5.0 ,"I'm using the speaker with my laptop, which (no surprise!) has a poor internal speaker. The sound quality is great for this use, and the battery life when used in this fashion (as opposed to continuous music playing) seems to be really long. Also, not having to deal with one more plugged-in electrical device is nice. Count me in as another happy customer."
,,daeskew53,this is great..,09 Jun 2015,5.0 ,WOW! this is great...A friend had one and had been using it for over a year without problems...I was so impressed with the sound I had to buy one....LOVE it!
,,seesee,SEESEE,21 Jan 2010,5.0 ,I was tired of the christmas music on the radio.I was looking for a portable speaker so I could listen to books on my Zune in the car.(because you are not supposed to used ear buds.) My son bought me an AltecLansing product for my zune so when i went looking i thought of Alteclansing again. The speaker sound is great. I love the 360 sound its compact and easily slipped into my bag. i would reccommend this product to anyone who wants clear crisp sound. I bought a cheap speaker from a corner store for $10.00 the sound was tinny. what a difference experience makes. seesee Altec Lansing iM-237 Orbit Ultraportable Speaker for MP3 Players (Silver)
,,Sung Jun Yoon,"Everything is OK, But, the Case Cover automatically push the button.",29 Mar 2011,4.0 ,"Everything is OK at this price, better than any other products. But, the Case Cover push the power button automatically when you carry the speaker. The Power Switch button should be lower than cover. So, I always double check the switch button in the bag. I have to carry the bag carefully. ************************************************** I love Altec Lancing Sound quality with previous experience. I would like to advice to Altec Lancing. 1. The Power Switch button should be lower than cover. 2. Opening the battery cover is not easy."
,,E. Rodriguez,This is it???,24 Jun 2011,3.0 ,"After reading the reviews for this speaker I was expecting a lot more. The sound quality is good and that's about it. I bought a phillips portable mini speaker at Target that was just as good. I like the portability of the phillips better because it is small and thin and easier to carry around. The sound quality of the Altec is better but only if you're really trying to look for a difference between the two. If I had known this before I wouldn't have gone through the trouble of getting it and stuck with my Phillips from Target. I wouldn't say it's a bad speaker, I'm just not impressed by any means."
,,Alan Mefford,Exactly What It Says It Is,21 Dec 2008,5.0 ,"I bought this as an auxiliary speaker for my iPhone 3G and it serves that purpose very well. I use it to listen to music while working on a project where ear buds would get in the way. It has good sound, good volume, attractive design, and is well made. The music is clean and crisp with no interference. It packs neatly away in the included case and is completely portable. It completely serves the purpose that it was designed for and the price is great."
,,TexasTex,Rock-out round speaker,06 Jul 2012,5.0 ,I bought this 2 months ago and use it all the time. The sound quality is amazing!!!! My co-workers were blown away at the volume & clarity it produces. I listen to a wide range of music from classical to hard rock and this speaker re-creats them all very well. I highly recomend this product.
,,Lin-Sue Lee,great buy,20 Feb 2015,5.0 ,"Bought 2! Great sound and hooks up to tablets, phone, kindle, I love this little speaker! So worth the price"
,,rich,Altec Lansing packs a punch,15 May 2016,5.0 ,"Bought 3 of these. They work great, good sound, good battery life, and can be used with a laptop."
,,Leo A. Sielsch,INNOVATIVE MINIATURIZATION,31 Oct 2011,5.0 ,"When I saw the name Altec Lansing, my thoughts went back many years. A name that in my memory was a mfr of high end speaker systems. I had been looking for a quality MP3 player that was portable and battery operated. I was surprised to find that the ultra-affordable iM-237 Orbit Ultraportable Speaker was from Altec Lansing. For its size you get outstanding base and good sound at surprising volumes. A beautiful traveling case that fits together so nicely, it is fun to pack it. A surefire sound investment. Leo's Fairway Lies"
,,ipadninja,"Good sound, small package",28 Dec 2011,5.0 ,"This is a great sounding speaker for the money. I purchased this to use with my iPad 2 and it is a big improvement over the built-in speaker. The sound is full with a good amount of low end (not tinny sounding like other small speakers) and plenty of volume. Skip the more expensive speakers and go for this portable speaker instead, the sound won't disappoint."
,,Joseph Sabia,Great Speaker!,03 Jan 2013,5.0 ,"Couldn't be happier. Recently dropped the portable SONY speakers I've owned for the past 12 years. Lansing has a great product here: well-made and sounds great. The only thing I dislike is the short and thin input wire. It's barely long enough to pick up the iPod without dragging the speaker along. Lansing's idea was to let the wire coil up underneath for storage, but I'd personally like to see a longer, beefier cable and just wrap it up myself with a rubber band. Still a great product!"
,,Formula Fun,Very good!,07 Jun 2013,4.0 ,This little guy rocks! The only reason I give it four stars is that you can not adjust the volume on the speaker itself. Which is not that big of a deal. I use it on my computer and phone and use the sound control on them. Very good and batteries last a long time.
,,Carpenter,A big little speaker,13 Oct 2011,5.0 ,"This speaker has a surprizingly big sound; enough to fill a small stadium. Anyway, for you prototype inventors out there who like to make your own portable sound systems for ipods or other mp3 players, but without the annoying ear buds, this is a cool big-little speaker."
,,Jonathan Troyer,Huge Sound From Such a Small Speaker! Love It!!!,03 Jun 2011,5.0 ,"I was very suprised at the sound quality of this little speaker. I bought it for use with my iPhone and it works great and simple set up (removed from box, add batteries, plug in & turn on). This speaker will get suprisingly loud without losing sound quality. I liked it so much I ordered my wife one the day I recieved mine. I have seen a few different types of portable speakers and none of them had sound quality or volume that impressed me like this one has and it's so portable(comes with case). I would and have recommended to others and all have been more than satisfied."
,,Rick Prescott,"Highly portable, great sound",12 Jul 2009,5.0 ,"I cannot praise this enough. I got one for a recent vacation near a lake, and every night I would plug it into may iPhone and use it for tunes around the campfire. This was four nights, and 4-6 hours per night at a decent volume. Batteries are still going strong (1000 mah rechargable Ni-MH), Sound was impressive, though I usually ended up setting the speaker sideways and aiming it toward the group. Another use for you iPhone/smartphone users is that it is a great speaker for conference calls and for use as a speakerphone. Much less tinny than the built-in iPhone speaker, it can really broadcast phone calls, streaming audio, anything you need amplified."
,,Islander,Just what I needed!!!,05 Aug 2011,5.0 ,"I just received my Altec iM227 speaker and I can say it is just what I needed. I like to listen to Audio books on my Nextbook. Now I don't need headphones, I can now leave the Nextbook in one place and hear it clearly almost anywhere I am, within reason.."
,,Rosalind M. Irvine,nice product,22 Jul 2011,4.0 ,This product came quickly and is exactly as described. 1. It is very nice and the sound is good especially for the price. 2. The back is sometimes hard to put on but I like that is connected to the speaker so I can't misplace it. 3. Take the batteries should be taken out between uses. 4. The instructions state @ no more than 90% sound loudness. So I hope I remember it.

,,Stephen Koch,Powerful Little Speaker,09 Dec 2011,5.0 ,"I have the iM237. I bought it for my wife who needed a speaker to play stuff for her class without taking much room. Wow!! This little speaker packs a punch. After hearing it myself, I got one for my office at work. It is not for audio snobs but for someone that wants clear crisp music with rich bass and pretty low cost, this is the speaker. I have hooked it to my Zune, my Windows phone and my laptop and every time I think that this was the best $20 I ever spent."
,,Bear K.,"It's good, but it dies easily",27 Sep 2012,3.0 ,"Got this not too long ago, thought it'd be great for camping and such. I used it less than 10 times, changed the batteries only once, then it died on me. The speaker was great, had great volume and everything else! But it died with less than 5 hours of total use. I bought another family member the rechargable X MINI speakers. The audio of X MINI wasn't as good as the Altec, and the rechargable batteries die faster, but it still works. Both have their good n' bads, but in the end, I'd rather have something that works."
,,Roger P.,Not what it was hyped to be,14 Apr 2013,3.0 ,"It is an ok speaker, I had distortion on the higher side of volume. The cord is really short. I wanted something with a little more bass and also wanted something that had 2 speakers inside the shell."
,,emilitza,You get what you pay for...or less.,15 Nov 2013,1.0 ,"This speaker is GARBAGE! I bought 3 of these for myself, my mom, & my fiance. They worked for 3-4 and then all just stopped working. The sound was OK for the price, but save your money & buy a nice speaker that will last longer than a couple months. On one of them you have to wiggle the cable to get it to work and it's all static...the other 2 just flat out don't work. We obviously tried new batteries but no luck."
,,Average Joe,Great Little Speaker,12 Dec 2012,5.0 ,This little speaker is really good for the price. I am impressed with the sound quality and clarity. I don't use it for listening to music. I use it to play podcasts.
,,Fey,Great little speaker,14 Nov 2014,5.0 ,"Great little speaker. Bought it for my spirit box, but have also used it to play music from my phone around the fire pit."
,,Robert F.,Sounds great!,16 Jan 2012,5.0 ,I actually bought this as a present for a friend but I did test it out after she opened it and liked it a lot. We both thought it sounded great for being a very small mono speaker. It's not too heavy and the cord wraps up nicely. Too bad it doesn't come with the little case anymore but my friend found a little cloth bag for hers and carries it in her purse. My friend has had the one I gave her for about three weeks now and she loves it. I initially heard it hooked up to my Blackberry with some hard rock music playing and she uses it with her iPod.
,,ILoveLivingRural,I Like The Original iM-207 Better!,26 Oct 2010,3.0 ,"Like some here, I purchased BOTH the iM-237 and the old model iM-207 that this model took the place of and lo and behold, I like the old iM-207 better! The iM-237 is larger than the iM-207 and to me, doesn't have any more volume than the old iM-207. I will admit, the 207's on/off switch sucks but I like it's sound better. If you can put up with the funky on/off switch of the iM-207,(which has gotten easier to use), I say go for it as it's selling for around $10.00 here on Amazon and that's a bargain! In fact, I'm using the iM-237's case to carry around the iM-207 and there's also room for my MP3 player."
,,CaliforniaSpartan,Music to My Ears,17 Sep 2010,5.0 ,"I saw the great ratings and reviews... exactly as I expected. This product has beat my expectations. My laptop which has great speakers already which my friends have commented on multiple times, don't compare anything to this little Altec Lansing speaker. I'm impressed with the fact I can't even turn my laptop volume up half way without waking up the house (at this hour / we live in a pretty big house). ... This thing will definitely work at a get togethers. <3"
,,Liora Hess,Wonderful for the iPhone,08 Nov 2011,5.0 ,"I like to listen to audiobooks while cleaning, and prior to purchasing this, I found myself straining to hear the tinny sound of my iPhone cranked up to highest volume. This has been such a handy item that immediately amplifies the sound of your gadget. There are no volume controls on the speaker itself; you'll need to do that from whatever device you've plugged the speaker into. All it needs is some batteries and for you to push the ""on"" button. I'm still on my first set of batteries, and I use this regularly. It's attractive and comes with a great little gray zippered case. It's a nice price and does the job if you're simply wanting a way to amplify your audiobooks and/or music at home, office or in the car."
,,B. Vance,No sound right out of package - Too late to return....,21 Jun 2014,1.0 ,"I already have one of these and it's great. Bought another one to give as gift in April but did not give/open/use it until June. It has power but no sound except for faint hum if you put your ear up to it. Unfortunately, too late to return or exchange because I did not open and test it right away. I'll know the next time to do this with every purchase. Bummer..."
,,Cliente de Amazon,Works perfect!,04 Jan 2017,5.0 ,Works perfect!
,,Robert Spencer,sounds great,17 Mar 2013,5.0 ,"Im really pleasently surprized how well this thing works.. I use this at my reloading bench which is a quit place, sound is clear and about 70% volume is plenty load, sometimes I turn it down to 50%ish. The sturdy construction contributes to this, no hum or distortion.. I have alot of hours on this thing and I have'nt had to replace the battery yet.. the small quit area I use this in and it's ease of use, make this the perfect choice,, I highly recommend it.."
,,Amazon Customer,Performs well,24 Feb 2014,5.0 ,"I have had this over a year now. It has been durable, sounds good, and has better battery life than I expected. I also uses ""real"" batteries you can replace, a plus for me.."
,,Kindle Customer,Does the job,31 Aug 2013,4.0 ,Just needed a small speaker for my desk and didn't want to spend a lot. This does the job. The on/off button could have been designed better - can easily hit it accidentally.
,,D. J.,Stopped working after less than a week,08 Mar 2012,1.0 ,"The unit was working great, for about a week. Then it started screaming and wailing at me in the middle of the afternoon. Woke me up from a nap, and scared the bejeezus out of my cat. I used my phone to take a quick video of this. Aside from the fact that it doesn't work, I still was not completely happy with my purchase. I didn't like that there was no auto shut off. You have to remember to hit the power button otherwise your batteries will be drained, and the power button is a little awkward to depress because its so small and recessed. And the cord is way too short. A retractable design with a slightly longer cord would have been more ideal. Even an extra 2 inches would have made a difference to me."
,,T. Collins,Quite a surprise.,27 Feb 2014,5.0 ,"This little speaker packs a punch! For something this inexpensive and having a name like Altec Lansing, this is a great buy. It has an amazing bass sound and is clear and loud enough to give the sound that is almost like a regular stereo from across a room. Great buy. A friend of mine bought one as well after hearing mine."
,,camojoe,great product,01 Dec 2011,5.0 ,I operate a 35000 lb tow motor all day and I love bluegrass music. I can't wear ear buds cause I need to hear whats going on around me and ear buds bother my ears. This product lets me listen to my bluegrass music when I can safely and be able to hear. Plus my ears don't get sore. This product is not a super stereo but I can hear all the instruments. I play doghouse bass and I like to be able to hear the bass when I listen to music. This unit has pretty good bass. It won't rock the house but bass level is high enough to blend with other instruments. Best alternative to ear buds for mp3's.
,,Deise,Five Stars,03 Jul 2016,5.0 ,Great and works very well! I love it!
,,Travis Double,Gives out quickly,13 Aug 2015,2.0 ,So Rad for the small amount of time it played music/ actually worked!
,,Cody,Decent sound but poor construction,07 Dec 2012,2.0 ,I got this speaker to listen to with my ipod at work. The sound is ok but it could be louder. I mainly listen to talk radio on it and I have to be standing right next to it to hear what they're saying. With music its much more louder. My main problem with it is the poor construction. The batter terminals are tiny pieces of metal that flex often and every time I change the batteries I have to take a knife and pry the terminals out so the batteries are making contact.
,,Welsis,Works Really Well,17 Feb 2014,5.0 ,"This small speaker fills a large room with sound. I needed something to boost my laptop sound for giving presentations to groups. It works well for the purpose. I don't worry about bass etc. It projects the human voice with enough volume to for about 20 people to hear a video presentation clearly. Cord is short, but it works. Works really well with my Dell laptop and Kindle HD."
,,botak4life,"compact with gigantic sound,,,,",29 Jun 2011,5.0 ,"after reading all the reviews here in amazon, i succumbed to order this speaker.it's meant to accompany me in the bike trail.the sound output is amazingly crispy and the bass is well within a very decent boom!i stuck the speaker in the outer part of my camelbak and the mp3(sansa)is clipped within my reach on top of my backpack.another avid mountain biker went with me and was amazed with the sound and purchased one for the trail.oh boy why did i start this trend...trails will be loud now."
,,FREDDY,SUPER !!!......but.....,09 Feb 2012,4.0 ,"I do exercises videos on the web (free), but the volumen on the laptop is low, even at 100% Sony VAIO, but with this speaker.....wow !!! what a difference, great sound, even at 48% of the volumen, which u control from the laptop, the only thing is that is run on batteries, next time i get the same ones, but the one that runs on USB......saves batteries. I recommend this speaker a lot.......but......get the one with USB."
,,JC Haywire,Solid Sound From A Compact Unit,27 May 2015,4.0 ,"Pretty good battery life and quite full sound for a monaural device. It is a little bulkier than necessary, but the stowing cord and simple operation give it a solid 4 star I LIKE IT rating. I would like to have a volume control, but none was advertised, so that's not a shortcoming."
,,Mitchell,Amazing sound quality,04 May 2014,5.0 ,"this tiny speaker impresses everyone that listens to it. Some would complain that the device cannot be recharged, but I favor the fact that I can simply put three new batteries in it. The batteries also last a long time, through many hours of listening. The disign is very durable, as well. Very convenient for trips, but the sound is good enough that I use it at home, too."
,,chuckmatthews,slick product,25 Nov 2011,5.0 ,"I checked out several reviews on these battery powered speakers... this was rated among the best and it delivered as advertised. I use it at football game tailgates and it works like a champ with my i-pod, droid and Pandora."
,,John Matthew Plummer,5 Years Strong Use Before Wire Finally Broke,16 Apr 2014,5.0 ,"I used these speakers (buy two and a splitter and make it surround!) so much, in so many countries, during so many parties, and under such extreme outdoor situations, you might think they cost significantly more than you paid. Affordable, adorable, and audible! Thank you, Altec Lansing."
,,M. kaiser,Favorite speaker!!,03 Sep 2015,5.0 ,"Love this little speaker! Hardy and tough little guy, outdoors, in humidity, cold, and all environments I have tested it has passed with flying colors! Plus good on batteries they last forever!"
,,JAMAS VONROCKMANN,only one thing came up short,20 Feb 2009,4.0 ,"The cords a bit short, 5 inches longer would of made this gem perfect for me. it's just a little too tag along. other than that, sound quality very clean,it cozies up with Pods nicely and travels well. technology has been good to me again. and just a little added note, Amazon Rocks !!!"
,,KOinKs,Orbit Speaker,07 Aug 2013,5.0 ,"I am a volunteer for a railroad safety program, have my own computer, but needed better speakers and the Altec Lasing iM227 Orbit MPs Speaker does the treak when I show a video."
,,J. Jones,"Great speaker, great service",05 Nov 2013,5.0 ,"I just purchased another one of these speakers because we use the one we have so much. I wanted an additional one to keep in our camping supplies. It's great for things like camping, because it has great sound when you're in the campsite, but it doesn't really project beyond that. I've actually purchased this speaker for a couple of family members as well I was so satisfied. Long battery life as well."
,,G. Kim,Orbit speaker,06 Mar 2014,5.0 ,"This item seems to be of good quality. It arrived very quickly and I am very satisfied. It works well, giving surprising sound for its size. This was a nice transaction."
,,J. Bach,Great Portable Speaker with a Nice Case!,18 Mar 2013,5.0 ,"You can't really fit it into your pants pocket, but you can clip the case to a belt loop. It is a great speaker for its size and the price w/ the case is very fair. I only use rechargeable batteries and keep an extra set handy. These speakers can be modded to add usb-charging, in which case you'd rarely have to switch batteries. You can get a 3.5mm stereo cable with mono-split ends and use two of these speakers set apart to get an even better sound."
,,HLW,Altec Speaker,08 Oct 2011,4.0 ,I am very happy with this speaker. I wish it was a little louder but it is sufficient for when you need an easy way to bring a speaker anywhere. I do recommend the item to other shoppers. The item came quickly & I would purchase from this seller again.
,,slackerchef,great little speaker!,23 Nov 2013,5.0 ,"great little speaker. sounds bigger than they are. the mini conector works well, but it is short... not really an issue for me. excellent solution for traveling."
,,Fel Angel,Read MY Review!,24 Sep 2014,5.0 ,Works great + cheap price = LOVE IT. UPDATE: 6 months later. We use it everyday. Working great.
,,RavenManiac,Perfect!,12 Aug 2011,5.0 ,"I was looking for a small portable speaker to take along to work with me. This little product is a gem. For a tiny speaker, it has great sound. I also like that it takes regular batteries. I just keep extra rechargables in my work bag. The little carrying case is a nice bonus, too. Very happy with my purchase."
,,reader83,Wonderful Small Speaker,20 May 2014,5.0 ,"I've bought several of these, both for myself and as gifts. They're small and very portable, and have great sound."
,,Isabel Alvarez,Little Man's cool.......,20 Nov 2010,5.0 ,"It not spectacular but its not low quality either. This things awsome for personal use when you dont feel like covering your ears. We all need to take breaks from headphones once in a while especially music lovers who have it night and day playing. I use this while my current car stereo gets an upgrade, just hanging out at the park, or (the favorite) going on bike rides in the evenings with the rest of the bike people of L.A. Its super easy to use and portable, it's a big leap forward from my Sony SRS-P11Q speakers."
,,Emily Mitsdarffer,Fantastic and Powerful,13 Sep 2012,5.0 ,"I bought this for my mother when we went camping. Not only did it save her the cost of 8 D batteries, it was just as powerful as the 20lb boom box she used to lug with her. She loves that she can charge it in her car, although she only had to once over 8 days. It's great that it's compatable with her little shuffle as well as my dad's iPhone. 2 of my aunts liked it so much that they asked for the link to buy their own. Overall a great purchase!"
,,JM,Altec Lansing iM-237 speaker,09 Sep 2013,4.0 ,"If you see it, buy it. Compact, good sounding unit which runs on 3 'aaa' batteries. Nice feature is that is has an 'on/off' button. Good sound and w/ custom skins available, (I went w/ the Beatles), you can customize your speaker."
,,Peter,"Nice sound, small size",05 Dec 2012,5.0 ,"It's not going to compete with serious stereo equipment, but it is great to plug into the laptop when I need a higher volume. There is no appreciable distortion to my (untrained) ears."
,,Consumerrobot,"Good product, good price.",26 May 2012,5.0 ,"I bought this in 2009, and it still works like the first day I got it. For it's size it puts out a lot of sound. Don't expect booming bass, this is a tweater. The only negative thing I can say is when the battery dies, the speaker puts out a screeching sound. Annoying, but the costco batteries I use will last weeks when playing all day at work. Just remember to turn off the battery when not in use. This would be the ultimate if you could plug in into the wall."
,,Arcani,Works Great!,03 Dec 2012,5.0 ,Got this to use with my SB7 frequency sweep for ghost hunting (Same thing used on GAC!) This unit is very loud and has plenty of base. I like the way the cord hides under the base too.
,,Nancy Rabbitt,Devices External Speaker,12 Apr 2014,5.0 ,"A great little speaker for phone, laptop, mp3, ipod. My little netbook has horrible sound playing music. This speaker makes it sound like it should. There are other external speakers out there--I bought an ihome for one. But none of them sound as good as this for its size. Everyone who sees it wants one of their own so I hope Altec Lansing keeps making them."
,,Fierce Goddess Warrior,Great sound while it works,07 Jan 2010,2.0 ,"I loved my little speaker for a month and a half while it was working. The sound was incredible for such a little speaker and it was very easy to use. About a month and a half of having it, after a minute or so of having it on, horrible static noise starts up and continues. I am disappointed with how little it lasted. Nowadays nothing seems to last long, but a month and a half seems a little ridiculous."
,,Benegesserit,Comes WITH the batteries and 2.5mm adapter!,21 Dec 2010,4.0 ,"Has pretty good loud sound with just a touch of static in quiet environments on the iPhone. It comes with the 3.5 mm female to 2.5 mm male adapter although the package and description says it does not. It also comes with three AAA Energizer batteries, which the decription says do not come with it. It is all set and ready to go! Makes a great gift. Sold OEM in a brown box, not in plastic clamshell packaging as pictured. Very easy to open packaging, well-packed too. Excellent case -- but with no place to store the 2.5mm adapter."
,,DSReed,Great for size and price!,08 Feb 2011,5.0 ,"This has been such a great purchase. Its not high end stereo equipment, but for the size and price it is fantastic. Good sound. Little bigger than I expected, but works well for me. So much so, my daughter steals it from me on occasion, I think she will need one of her own very soon!"
,,Eileen Eckhardt,I love this! It is bigger and louder than you ...,20 Nov 2014,5.0 ,"I love this! It is bigger and louder than you might think. I got it , ( along with an inexpensive Mp3 player ), to put in my shrubs to make owl and cricket sounds on Halloween night. You can here them chirping away from the side walk. I may get another for the other side of the house, (we live on a corner)."
,,Jenni,I wanted to love this!,24 Jun 2013,3.0 ,"I wrote a review when I first got this item. I have since found the perfect placement for the speaker to work. And it actually works really well. I wish it had a volume control (and didn't short out). But when it is working, it works great. This little speaker seemed like it was going to be just what I needed, however, right out of the package it had a short in the cord. I am so disappointed."
,,Hutch,Amazing Speaker,09 Feb 2013,4.0 ,"Great sound from such a small package. Highly recommend ordering a longer cable with it. The one that comes with it is too short. Also it uses about a set of batteries within 8 hours, so stock up or buy rechargeable."
,,Me,Better than expected,02 Nov 2011,5.0 ,After reading lots of reviews I wasn't sure if I'd like it. Fortunately the little speaker works great. I use it with my laptop because the laptop speakers are weak and pointed up instead of at me. I plug this in and point it at my face and the volume jumps 10-fold. Very satisfied!
,,Greg,Best all around portable speaker for my ipod.,16 Jul 2010,5.0 ,"Use this speaker to play ambient music in an art gallery where I work as well as in an art class. Sound level is adequate with brilliant highs and very little distortion. I have gotten many compliments on it and several people have asked where they can buy one. I even bought another one as a gift. I have had a number of small portable speakers for my ipod including JBL, Sony, and others and, in terms of portability and sound quality this one is clearly the best. Highly recommended."
,,M. Pujols,Cool product,06 May 2014,5.0 ,Nice to have when nothing else is available. Definitely louder than just a cell phone speaker. I'd recommend this to anyone.
,,Red141,Great sound from such a small package.,03 Jul 2012,4.0 ,"Disclaimer: I am not an audiophile. I think the sound that comes out of this is great. More serious audio enthusiasts may disagree but for it's size, I think it does the job. Oh, the price was great too."
,,MJS,Really like this,07 Dec 2012,5.0 ,"We use this speaker on trips or just sitting on the patio. We use our smartphones and mp3 players and simply plug into this speaker for better sound. I wish it had volume control, however."
,,SleepyMooCowKitty,Great little speaker,31 May 2014,5.0 ,"Plugs into my iPod, laptop, whatever else and is nice & loud. Great price for a good product. The wire wraps around the bottom for storage too which is a nice feature. Shipped quickly."
,,el_mundo,good sound quality,18 Feb 2011,4.0 ,"i use this to play music from an ipod in the bathroom. sounds great, sounds much louder than it looks and easily overpowers the shower. good mid-bass. some distortion when you get to the 85% range, but still very listenable. only complaints are the power button is hard to get to sometimes, and the cord is a little short. looks cool and pretty small size. a little tall tho but i think it helps the sound quality."
,,EGoldy,Small speaker - small sound,12 Dec 2012,3.0 ,This product was not a bad product - you simply get what you pay for. I've seen others with similar speakers and better sound so my expectations were higher. The sound is tinny and the base does get buried a bit. Overall - this is a nice speaker for portability and ease of use.
,,Galagunpampers,Not bad at all!,23 Jul 2011,4.0 ,"I received this product a couple of weeks back and I must say, for the price I paid, I am very impressed with the sound that it's producing. Don't get me wrong, the sound won't blow you away, but it is more than enough for on the go listening. It produces decent bass, clear mids, and clear highs. What I did notice is that certain songs sound either sound louder or lower on this speaker, probably due to the download quality of the mp3. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking a cheap, portable, and decent sounding speaker."
,,DROCK,Decent Speaker,21 Jan 2013,4.0 ,Gets the job done. Has decent sound for it's size. Power button not well located therefore it's easy to hit it when transporting or storing and you'll have dead batteries.
,,rufusmaximus,a good portable option,12 Jan 2011,4.0 ,I purchased this for use in my vehicle and office. Two people have commented positively on the volume. The speaker is a littler bigger than expected but that's not a problem. So far my only issue is the length of the cord as it very short which is the reason my rating is not 5 stars. The case is a big plus. No need to worry about transporting the speaker.
,,Ms. Angela Elkington,Great speaker.,05 Sep 2014,5.0 ,It is an awesome little speaker which I attach to my ipod. I can now listen to music whilst in the shower and the music comes out nice and clear.
,,D F,Just one not enough!,30 May 2009,4.0 ,"Wanted to get a decent gift for my sister, so I bought the iM-237 online at a price of $28 (w/ $6 Standard Shipping). My wife opened the package as soon as it came, to try it out. But she fell in love with the look & especially the sound output, so she's keeping it. Had to buy another one for my sister :-) Definitely a keeper, if you're in the market for a small but powerful speaker in the 20-30 ft range. 4 stars because: a) Just wish the cord was a bit longer, and b) No AC adapter for indoor use (needs 3 AAA batteries)"
,,WALLY NY,The Little Speaker That Can,02 Nov 2009,5.0 ,"I bought this speaker to hook to my Iphone/Ipod when i am at work.I re-finish kitchens in customers homes. I comes with a case with a clip that i attatch to my tool bucket. I sounds really good,simple operation and looks cool. To me,Altec Lansing has a reputation for quality,and this little gem of a speaker lives up to it's name. Buy It"
,,Maimbo,Good little speaker. Good sound for the size.,27 Jul 2013,5.0 ,"This is a good little speaker, sounds good for the size. My only complaints are that I wish it the speaker plug was a tad longer, and that there was a volume button on this."
,,David R. Chasse,good enough sound,15 Nov 2009,4.0 ,pros - good enough sound long life using NiMi rechargable batteries nice size cons - cord too thin power goes on and off randomly uses 3 batteries - odd number for recharging solutions - wrap rubber bands across the speaker to keep the too thin cord from putting strain where it goes into the unit. Also with the rubber band can secure your music device. For power going in and out - use a small flat head screw driver or other tool to pry metal connectors out a little so the batteries fit more securely(be careful not to over pry)
,,Martello,Great for the price,10 Apr 2009,5.0 ,"This is a good little speaker for the price. It's not stereo or high fidelity but the sound is good for situations where you'd rather not use buds or headphones. Also, it's surprisingly powerful if you raise the volume on your device, the speaker can get quite loud. Batteries seem to last. So overall considering it's performance, price & lightweight portability, this is a good buy. You can also plug it into a laptop to get better sound than built-in laptop speakers."
,,Matthew,Perfect Little Speaker,27 Jun 2012,5.0 ,This little speaker can put out major sound. Fits in the palm of my hand and is perfect for listening to my mp3 player around the house. Construction seems sturdy and I like how compact it is. Super fast shipping!
,,DB Johnson,Good Speaker,23 Jul 2013,4.0 ,"I needed a small speaker to take camping when I ride my motorcycle......I wanted good sound, better price and it has to be compact. It's all those, however, the cord is crazy short! You'll have to buy a female to female connection and another cord unless you're ok with the set up. Other than that....I'm happy."
,,"lara,o",A must have,01 Nov 2014,5.0 ,Super kick buttt speaker. Nice and loud clean sound. Cordless and easy charge last hours
,,Amazon Customer,Five Stars,23 Dec 2016,5.0 ,"Awesome speaker and it actually works, unlike the last speaker I bought on Amazon."
,,KrazyKajun,Good,19 Apr 2013,3.0 ,"For the money it's a good little speaker. 2 cons: 1 not rechargeable, needs to change batteries when dead. 2 wish it were louder. pros: on board cord storage prevents damage in transit, decent sound."
,,Maoli Man,great little speaker!,16 Jun 2012,5.0 ,"I love this little speaker, very loud for it's size, it is an upgrade from it's predecesor, I forgot the model # but it was the black one. This one is a little more durable, the sound quality is the same. I'd give this a 2 thumbs up. If your'e looking for a portable speaker consider this one before purchasing anything else. Im satisfied with this purchase."
,,Michael Lick,This little speaker rocks,06 Jun 2014,4.0 ,I use this on my bike and around the house. It gets loud enough to be heard while I'm cooking or working on my bicycles or riding around town (I've strapped it to my front rack). Its pretty sturdy but the cable is definitely the weak point and should be handled gently.
,,SArt,One Star,29 Nov 2014,1.0 ,"Not a good product, I did use it a few times and then it went into the garbage bin"
,,Savvy Shopper,Delivers as promised.,26 Jan 2009,4.0 ,"This product delivers what it promises: ultra-portable, but still has volume and bass. I use it when traveling abroad while I stream radio shows on my computer. My laptop's speakers aren't powerful enough to hear all around the room/apartment, but this speaker is, and it sounds great. Also, battery-operated, so no extra cables, and I can put it where ""I"" want it, rather than behind the couch, where the only outlet seems to be. At home, I use the JBL on-stage II, which has stereo sound, a remote-control, and superior volume. But overall, a solid and portable device for mobile volume! Perfect for road-warrior types. Enjoy!"
,,Michael Thibodeaux,very nice!,13 May 2013,5.0 ,"I ordered this speaker after hearing a colleagues pop up type speaker. I searched Amazon.com and saw this little gem. Altec Lansing offers excellent quality, design and sound! I use it with my phone, kindle fire hd and my laptop. I do laptop presentations on the products I sell and the speaker really helps with the sound! Don't buy the plastic popup gimmicky units, get this one and you'll be extremely satisfied."
,,KitchenKutter,A COMPLETE JOY.,20 Jul 2012,4.0 ,"VERY PRACTICAL. I USE THIS DEVICE WITH MY IPHONE TO LISTEN TO PANDORA RADIO, OR JUST TO WATCH THINGS ON YOUTUBE ETC. I HAVE HAD IT FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS AND I AM EXTREMELY GLAD I BOUGHT THIS."
,,Amira J. Sayler,Great portable outdoor speaker,28 Jul 2014,5.0 ,"My husband uses this when he is golfing and he absolutely loves it. It finally broke after a year or two of heavy use, so we just replaced it with the exact same one and it is still going strong! Nice and compact so it fits into his golf bag, but has great sound quality."
,,telephone man,good for the money,12 May 2011,4.0 ,"very easy to use. one button on/off. one plug to the earphone jack of your device. some people complain that it doesn't have a volume control. big deal. on on iphone you have two ways to control volume, the button on the side and the slide. why have one more? the sound quality is not as good as some reviewers tout. I am not complaining, mind you. for it's size it does quite well, is clear and crisp. but don't expect concert quality from a speaker that fits in the palm of your hand."
,,Shu Liu,excellent for the price,25 Dec 2011,5.0 ,"This product is pretty good for the price. Construction is pretty good and i think that i can carry this around with me with confidence. It also looks sleek and the tangle free system works perfectly. Ok now onto the sound. At medium volume, i hear no distortion and the sound is pretty excellent with pretty good bass but once cranked up it sounds distorted. It is pretty loud too. Overall excellent for only 13 dollars"
,,Bobv,I am very happy with it,07 Sep 2015,5.0 ,"Works very well, I am very happy with it."
,,D. Barnhill,Love this speaker.,26 Feb 2013,5.0 ,"This speaker sounds amazing for the size. It is very easy to take with you. Since it has it' own batteries, it uses very little power from you mp3 player/phone."
,,Paul Stoutamire,awesome speaker,03 Nov 2013,5.0 ,"Great speaker. Loud as you need it to be, and being able to string to other speakers opens the door to limitless volume possibilities. I love it and wish I had 3 more."
,,mollipop,Excellent Sound in a Small Package,22 Aug 2012,5.0 ,"I purchased this speaker for a car trip, and I am very pleased with the quality. I was able to hear my music clearly even traveling at highway speed with the window open. This is a very nice little speaker that will work in a variety of situations."
,,gakkygreeneyes,Great sound quality in a small package,18 Jun 2013,5.0 ,"I purchased this for traveling. I enjoy listening to music while sitting on a hotel balcony, drinking a glass of wine or a beer and watching the sun set, but most hotels do not provide a means for listening to your own devices. This little speaker is perfect to replace a very old set of speakers I was previously using. The sound quality is excellent and the size of the device makes is easily portable."
,,Melody,Five Stars,19 Nov 2014,5.0 ,After a year it just quit working. no particular reason. It just started buzzing.
,,Jim S.,Five Stars,13 Aug 2015,5.0 ,Great portable speaker. The sound is great
,,Alan,Good product,16 Apr 2012,5.0 ,"I originally came to buy another speaker but read other reviews and decided to go with this one. I really like it great sound and the volume is surprising from a little speaker. The bass fades a bit a really high volumes but its not an issue in my book, you can't expect the moon. The only one complaint I have about it is the size. I bought it for on the go and its a chunk for any pocket but over all I still really like it."
,,Wendy,Not as good as older model,24 Sep 2012,2.0 ,"Bought because a friend had an older model. This model does not have as good sound as the older one. Easier to turn on/off, but too easy to turn on (push button will turn it on if you chuck it in a bag, for instance... and will use up the battery). Also the cord could be a little longer!!! I would not buy another of these, but would look at other brands / models."
,,WildKatz,watch price fluctuations,09 Aug 2012,5.0 ,"Purchased in Oct., 2011. This thing sounds awesome (with a Sony Walkman mp3 player), has great battery life and is holding up well. But I paid thirteen bucks for it brand new from Amazon. It seems the price has significantly increased since then...currently thirty to forty bucks from non-Amazon merchants, but fulfilled by Amazon. Maybe if Amazon carries it again, the price will be more reasonable."
,,Kirstie,Good travel speaker,23 Aug 2011,5.0 ,"I travel a lot for work and this has been a great addition to my suit case. It isn't as loud as large non-portable speakers but it does a pretty good job. Down side is that when the batteries are low on charge and there is a loud noise played, it makes an awful sound. Just replace the batteries and the problem goes away. For the price, you can't beat this little speaker!"
,,Stanley Joe Wynman,Nice Sound,08 Sep 2014,5.0 ,This little speaker and amplifier look and work great. Has its own internal battery
,,CJF,Great speaker (but I'll still scrutinize it on one thing),09 Dec 2012,4.0 ,"Great sound, great battery length, great size, great parts! This speaker was just what I was just what I was looking for. The ONLY downside is what happens when the it's on low battery for too long. Instead of having the music just slowly die out, all of a sudden very LOUD static starts shooting out of the speaker. At least it's a 'nice' way to alert me to charge my batteries (yes this was done with rechargeable batteries so I'm unsure about other people's outcomes on this)."
,,Yeti,Rocking little speaker,29 Dec 2011,5.0 ,"Watched many reviews on YouTube and decided to give this one a try, It projects the sound with rich bass, and sound quality remain wonderful in high volume. very reasonable price for the quality. almost feel like it could worth more. downside: size is a little bigger than other mini speakers on the marker."
,,Earleen,wonderful,19 Mar 2009,5.0 ,"speaker is easy to operate, east to hook up. The cover protects the speaker and serves as a handy carrying case. Sound is great for such a little package. the cord wraps around easily. Everything described in the ad is accurate."
,,Ben Burgdorf,Such a huge sound from such a small box!!,07 Oct 2011,5.0 ,"This a handly speaker to have around. It offers such a surprising deep melodious sound from such a small device. I would have liked a bit longer of a cord...however, as far as the peformance of the device goes it gets a 5 star rating from me!!"
,,Jayhawj,iPod/Touch speaker,31 Jul 2010,4.0 ,"This a nice sounding speaker. Perfect for travel. Fits easily in a carry on bag. I use it mostly to watch/listen to iTunes University courses while I walk on a treadmill. It has plenty of distortion free sound for voice, jazz and classical music. At work, I can connect my iTouch either to a Bose Clock Radio or this speaker...as normal background sound in an office setting I don't notice much difference. Battery life is longer than advertised. The nitpiks...the on/off button could be a little bigger...the connection cord longer. All in all, money well spent. I am pleased."
,,Shadowatcher,Great form factor,10 Dec 2013,5.0 ,This little speaker is great for the car. We use it sometimes at the breakfast table to listen to Audible books that we buy.
,,K. Ekman,Could be great! Cord too short and mine had problems.,24 Aug 2011,4.0 ,"The cord is far too short on this item. Besides that, it is great! Except mine... it was very finicky about the battery cover. I had to have it *just right* for it to work... and just right was not all the way closed. Anyone else have that problem? The sound is good, battery life is surprisingly long, but I have to return it because of the finicky issues. I liked it so much I almost kept it in spite of it."
,,Matthew,Very handy,30 Jan 2011,5.0 ,"Good price, good quality. I use it to listen to NPR and Pandora when I don't want to wear headphones & am away from my computer or stereo. I've also found it to be useful when sharing a video or other media on my Droid X/Ipod/Laptop and showing several people. So, if you want an entry level portable speaker, this is great, but don't expect bass & use it at a reasonable volume."
,,Leonid Yelizarov,Good product,27 May 2017,5.0 ,Used this thing for years. Good product
,,Nerak,"Compact, gread sound!",10 Sep 2011,5.0 ,"Great for camping, traveling or anywhere you need your own music. The carry case protects the speaker when transporting, so you can simply toss in your bag and go. I have used this to listen to music in rental cars that do not have mp3 hookups too!"
,,Optmo,Good sound,01 Mar 2013,4.0 ,"This thing is a great addition to my iphone and ipad. It is great when listening to music. I would have liked and stronger volume but hey, what can you ask for that price?"
,,Laurie A Will,Great Sound,30 May 2013,5.0 ,This is my second one. I was listening to my MP3 player while my mother was visiting and she thought the sound was so good and amazed it came out of such a small inexpensive speaker. I bought her one and an MP3 player for her birthday. She loves it.
,,LikesAmazonStuff,Wow! Superb sound.,10 Nov 2011,5.0 ,"I have been looking for a compact speaker for my iPod Touch for a long time. I'm so glad I purchased this. The sound is BIG! Really a nice, full sound. I'm surprised at how well this plays through the whole EQ spectrum for its size and price. And finally, a speaker that is loud enough so that I can listen to music or understand a radio talk show through the noise of taking a shower. And I can actually listen to it while I'm blow drying my hair. Tip: works best if put by a reflective surface such as next to a wall or window. It fills a room better that way. Very pleased with this product and I highly recommend it."
,,Marty Nemko,Quite the little miracle,29 Oct 2012,5.0 ,"How can such a little device produce such good sound---and at good volume! And at a great price?! The inventors of such technologies are, to me, unsung heroes."
,,Shop-a-hollic,Icky product,11 Dec 2013,1.0 ,Nothing wrong against the company who sells them. But WOW how horrible the speaker sounded. I sent it back and purchased another speaker which I am very happy with. I went to a store that I could play with the speakers before buying them.
,,sqrly,Decent little speaker with good sound. Batteries could last longer,12 Jun 2015,4.0 ,Decent little speaker with good sound. Batteries could last longer. And next time I'd rather go with a bluetooth speaker since this has a short cord and has to be plugged into the phone.
,,Killer67,"Should work for more than 60 days, no?",14 Aug 2012,1.0 ,"I loved this (note past tense). What a great sounding little speaker. Why couldn't it be built to last longer than two months,or give you some signs that it was about to crap out? No warning, it just gave up the ghost. Why such a short life? Why did the Lord take you from me so early, but long enough to be OUT OF THE AMAZON REFUND PERIOD. Like most things in life,(say it with me, People) you get what you pay for."
,,"John A. Wilson, Jr.",Great little speaker,18 Nov 2009,5.0 ,"I was looking for a speaker that I could use in my car after my car speakers finally gave out. Instead of buying and installing new speakers, I now use a walk-man type player and this speaker in my car. It is plenty powerful and fits perfectly in the drink holder in the center console. This is exactly what I was looking for and it works great. The only drawback is that the on/off button is super sensitive and if you put it back in the case, you may turn the thing back on and drain all of your batts. The speaker was just as described and the cost was just right."
,,The Sane,Great little speaker,27 Apr 2014,5.0 ,Great little speaker. Inexpensive and clear sound. I use it most of the time to listen to the radio with it hooked to my mobile phone instead of my hi-fi. Turning on the hi-fi is too troublesome.
,,Greg From Oregon,This is very good product!,04 Aug 2009,5.0 ,"For a portable speaker this unit is very close to perfect. Its small, a set of batteries will last hours, and has good sound quality. There really isnt any other product that compares to it in this price range. The Altec Orbit (iM-207)I bought before this one hit the market was also good. It was good enough someone stole it, which is why I bought this unit. Its a good solid decent sounding speaker for personal listening levels. Take the advice from a reviewer and make a spot when the back is closed to facilitate removing and attaching the back plate when changing batteries."
,,erikjen,Good Speaker!,18 Jul 2010,5.0 ,"I was looking for a small speaker with decent volume to play from my mp3 player on my bike. Headphones block too much ambient sound and they are illegal to use in some places (n a bike). This speaker has sufficient volume, good battery life (so far) and is portable. On/Off switch, about as easy as it gets! I wish it had a slightly longer cable but I just got a 3' which will reach anywhere I need to. Nice carry case. Would work great with a laptop. Sound quality is better than I expected from such a small speaker. Reccomend! Erik"
,,Elizabeth Ross,Don't buy it,30 Dec 2011,1.0 ,"I've had this speaker for 6 months. it was great at first but after three months. Of very little use it began screeching with both my iPod and iPhone, I've read numerous reviews on other sites claiming the same problem. Buy a bigger speaker - the extra money is worth it. Altec Lansing iM-237 Orbit Ultraportable Speaker for MP3 Players (Silver)"
,,ArtyTheBeachDude,Great Unit with two flaws,08 Dec 2013,3.0 ,I love this speaker but the only reason I gave it a 3 star rating is because #1 the speaker cord is just too short. Ridiculously short. #2 the unit constantly cuts on when it is properly in the case because the casing rubs against the ON button. Other than that I love it.
,,Lois L. Sell,Love it bought a second one after I got the first one ..,02 Oct 2013,5.0 ,I love it wenow have to and use them to get EVP'S with my daughter and I use them a lot we even hook them up to our Lap tops to hear even better and the seller is right on the mark with returning emails and tech help you must love a honest seller one who is there even after the sell is done and over with would buy from this seller again ..

,,Broad Shoulders,Very functional does it's job,11 Jan 2015,3.0 ,I wish you could control the volume and have a longer cord. But it is well crafted.
,,Richard J.,A Must have with the SB11!,27 May 2015,5.0 ,"I love these guys, I bought a pair for my SB 11 set up."
,,Beersnob,Great for its size and price,22 Apr 2011,5.0 ,"Perfect for when you want to sit outside with friends without hauling equipment. In a setting with a lot of people, it probably wouldn't generate enough volume, but for intimate settings it's perfect."
,,William L. Duncan,"Great little speaker, but be careful for small design flaw",04 Sep 2010,3.0 ,"I purchased this little speaker in September 2009, after much research & trying out a few others. I was immediately impressed by the abundance of quality sound that came out of such a small speaker. Everything was great for a while, but a few months ago the cord began to come loose from the male connector of the unit, exposing the thin speaker wire inside. All it took was one instance when the speaker was connected to my IPod, and the Ipod dropped out of my hand causing it to dangle from the speaker for a second. Then the metal speaker wires became visible (the rubber sheathing got pulled back from the 'fall'). I tried to place electrical tape around the bare area to help protect the wires from fraying & bending (or worse) but this proved futile over time, as the wires grew weak & have now almost broken. Now, to even get sound out of the speaker, I have to bend the connector (which is surrounded by tape) slightly back & forth until I can hear full sound (left & right channels go in & out as it bends) come out of the speaker, but this is only works for a few minutes until the wire bends back into its state of disrepair. So, as long as you take extra care of the cord and don't ever let any type of mp3 or Ipod that weighs any amount to fall & hang from the unit, or get pulled away from the speaker with any amount of force, you'll be okay. Now, I'm looking for another speaker. I like this one, but the flawed cord design will make me look elsewhere."
,,Amazon Customer,It had good sound but my second one only lasted a year ...,09 Jun 2017,1.0 ,"It had good sound but my second one only lasted a year and a half , the first one 2 years . For that price i expected it to last longer."
,,D. Shane Knisley,I have used this speaker extensively and suppose I got ...,24 Oct 2015,3.0 ,I have used this speaker extensively and suppose I got my money's worth but still after about a year the power button got to be very finicky about staying on and caused me to finally throw it away.
,,Class of '69 - So Fine,Good While It Lasted,01 Oct 2013,2.0 ,I realize I have owned this for over one year but it stays in my laptop case & I only use it when on the road. Excellent bass but the cord needs to be longer. The short length interferes with my hands on the keyboard. It only lasted for about 10 - 15 connections. Class of '69 So Fine
,,fractals_and_stars,Yes! music at the beach!,01 Jul 2011,5.0 ,Awesome. Super reasonable price with great sound. I have seen many other sets of portable speakers with two smaller speakers. This single speaker is bigger and sounds better than two small ones. I took it to the beach for a week and the batteries are still kickin. There is no ipod dock to be annoying and in the way as I plug my Zune in with the adapter cord. Comes with smaller adapter so it can be plugged into a 2.5mm headphone jack on a cell phone. Carrying case protects so I am comfortable tossing it in my beach bag.
,,Don K,Perfect for what I wanted,06 Feb 2010,5.0 ,"This amplifier is perfectly suited for portability. It can be used anywhere with a minimum of fuss. I use it around the house, in the car, outside, and toss it in the luggage when traveling. Its audio quality and volume is fine. I consider it a plus that it only has one speaker. That makes it as compact as possible. It would be silly to compromise size and convenience just to have an ineffective tiny little stereo."
,,sbcatman,Just okay !!,27 Sep 2013,3.0 ,Not worth it for the price and found speakers in stereo for less money that sounded much better !!! Would not buy again !!
,,Kode,WOW,18 May 2010,5.0 ,"This litte speaker is amazing. For the size that it is I cant belive how loud it is. You have to conrtol the volume by your mp3 device but it sounds great. I'd read other reviews on here saying the same thing an it is truely amazing. It's very easy to get to the battery compartment and the on off switch is a buttin, I like the green light that tells you whens the speaker is on or off. The case fits snuggly but not too tight; the clip is just a cheap plastic thing but it still works. It just came yesterday so I'll have to see how everything does over time."
,,Wicked Uncle,convenient quality speaker,19 Sep 2009,5.0 ,"I bought a WOOT two for one deal on the cheaper brother to this speaker. I gave them to my children who appreciated their convenience and sound. I bought this more expensive model for its on/off button and advertised richer sound. The sound may be better. The switch assuredly is. I returned one needlessly since all it needed were three FRESH 3A batteries. But Altec Lansing replaced the speaker promptly and paid for shipping back. Great speaker, great company, great convenience."
,,R. Mustafa,Good little Speaker,25 Feb 2013,4.0 ,"Please note that this speaker is Mono not stereo. My reason for buying was I wanted a loud, clean sound for the purpose of listening to audio books in my car, (my car cd player is kaput). So, let me just say that It is very good for my purposes right now. Another plus is ... it also seems to be very kind to batteries."
,,DynoShip,Excellent sound for it's price and size,14 Jan 2012,5.0 ,"Very neat device. I use it with a tablet, and my wife with her 11.6"" laptop she carries to work. It is only mono, but I'll take clear mono audio over scratchy or tinny sounding stereo anytime. Nice design, and seems fairly rugged for being mostly plastic."
,,Flying Circus,Great little speaker!,02 Apr 2013,4.0 ,"Bought this to hear GPS directions in car. (No blue-tooth) Great for that purpose: Unit is compact (fits in cupholder) and does the job. One issue: ultra-short 3.5mm cable. Had to get extension to reach GPS. Otherwise, fills the bill!"
,,Music Fan,portable speaker,04 Jul 2013,3.0 ,"Its good for the price. Not the quality I was hoping for. As you increase the volume, the sound becomes noticeably distorted."
,,David Kalt,Great value,09 Feb 2011,5.0 ,"Great value speaker. I bought this speaker for use while cooking or working in the garage. Works great for both uses. It's small, portable, and makes good use of batteries. I've had several people ask about it. For $25 it's hard to beat. I have no complaints. If you want something really loud with a lot of base, you wouldn't be looking at this speaker in the first place."
,,Marty,Great sounds,06 May 2012,4.0 ,"Nice bit of kit and happy for the beach, park or using with your MP3 or laptop, tablet etc. The sound quality is excellent for a small speaker but good bass tones. I would have given 5 stars howvever the only downside is that the cable from speaker to player is far too short, maybe 4-5inches, sometimes size is everything. However a nice item to have stowed in your backpack for days out."
,,shannon mcdaniel,fine,20 Feb 2014,4.0 ,it works as it should and the sound quality is well. I gave it as a gift and they were very pleased
,,Millie,Surprisingly Big Sound,29 May 2010,4.0 ,"Well, I like the Orbit, my friends like it, and I recommend it. I've only had it for about a month or two. Very easy to carry around and a very uncomplicated device. I didn't expect the sound quality to be that great but it exceeding my expectations, and I don't expect much. I use it all the time while gardening. The sound is loud enough for me to hear and enjoy the music outside, but not so loud as to disturb my neighbors. The only thing I don't like about it is the short cord. Would I do it again? Yeah..sure...why not!"
,,Jess,Awesome,29 Oct 2013,5.0 ,"Small, portable, not a battery hog, inexpensive , sounds good. A great device for those who don't want to break the bank."
,,Och,Great sound,23 Apr 2013,4.0 ,Great sound from a little guy and it uses AA batts so you don't have to charge it. But if your're green you can always use rechargeables!!
,,P. J.,iM-237,17 Jul 2010,5.0 ,"For a speaker of it's size, the sound is surprisingly good. Battery life, even with rechargeable batteries is excellent. If I had to get picky about anything, it would be the short audio connector cable. If it was a bit longer this speaker would be about perfect. The cable isn't a show stopper though and I would not hesitate to purchase the iM-237 again."
,,Muriel M. Bossert,Ultra portable speaker for mp3 player & iPhone,18 Aug 2011,5.0 ,"My son went to an Otakon convention and he dressed as Dr.Who/DJ. He used these to make the DJ scratch board. It turned out fantastic! (check it out on the otakon pages on youtube). He is already in the process of making a ""new & improved"" version for the AnimeNext, MangaCon, and Otakon conventions for next year! He (and all of the people that were around him) had a great time dancing around with these speakers! Thanks Amazon! Muriel"
,,Nelson Mandela,Migthy little speaker,23 Sep 2009,5.0 ,"I bought this little speaker to use it in my dtrips outside the city, I'm not dissapointed the sound is great, it's small, loud and cristal clear, just don't use them at the max volumen and you are going to enjoy this awesome device, the price is good as well, I wish the audio cable would be a little longer though. I hope this is usefull to you, and sorry for my bad English :D"
,,Steelheart,Might have gotten a bad one,27 Nov 2012,1.0 ,The volume was so-so the first times I used it. It didn't seem to matter if I was using rechargeable or alkaline. I kept it around for occasional use and the last time I went to use it I got nothing. I replaced the batteries and still nothing. The best guess I have is that the switch on mine broke after a couple months of minimal use. Time to start looking for a replacement but it won't be one of these. Steelheart
,,JWR,"Portable, simple, but prone to trouble",23 Dec 2012,3.0 ,"This speaker has served alright as a portable item to throgh in the suitcase. However, it seems to have a problem with ""giving out"" after playing for a while. It's not that it shuts off, but instead it gets a certain note stuck and plays a single, high pitched note at a loud wail until turned off. It's inexpensive, but in retrospect I'd recommend spending a bit more for a better product."
,,Adrock77,Excellent for what it's intended to be,22 Apr 2011,5.0 ,"This is a great speaker. It's loud, has good sound quality, and puts out good bass for something so small. I bought this for camping/backpacking and it serves its purpose perfectly. With shipping I paid $23, I'd say that's fair. As for other $20 speakers, I've had two different ones and this blows them away. Sure there are better sounding speakers, but not in this price range, and size. As long as you're not expecting a home theater experience you will be more than happy."

,,Rmac,The sound is great,16 Jan 2012,5.0 ,"This little speaker sounds fantasic, now I need to get another for someone else that wants one. Its so small yet sounds so good, takes little room on my desk."
,,Pat_Los_Gatos,"Sweet sound, broken switch",27 Nov 2011,3.0 ,"The sound from this little speaker is amazing. I know it's not stereo but it produces good sound with a strong bass for its size. In fact, I compared it to a friend's stereo pair of travel speakers and the bass on this one was so rich it blew the other travel speakers away. However, it has an on-off switch to save battery juice and that switch broke within the first week. I plan on returning the unit and i hope the replacement doesn't have the same problem."
,,S. Williams,Wish it had more Bass but works as Expected,16 Jan 2012,4.0 ,"The Orbit MP3 speaker works great right out of the box. It didn't come with any AAA batteries, but that's ok. I wish it had more Bass, but I didn't really expect much with the compact size. I like that they have designed a place on the bottom to store away the cord. So far I am happy with the purchase."
,,T Scogin,Larger but worth it!,03 Jan 2014,5.0 ,"I purchased both this and the XBOOM Ceramic capsule speaker to use in 2 different places, but to also compare them for future purchases. The Altec has a much fuller sound than the XBOOM(which was a buck more - but smaller) and just even sound from both high and low end. I fully recommend it - also because it take AAA batts."
,,Jeannine,Four Stars,16 Mar 2015,4.0 ,It is good. Battery died pretty quit.
,,J. L. Case,Nice little speaker,27 Mar 2009,4.0 ,"Update as of 24Sept09: It has started make popping sounds and can quit in the middle of a song. I would not buy this speaker again. Got this little speaker for work. The sound is good for its size but the next generation could do with some improvements. The cord should be longer, say another 12 inches. The base of the cord should have some sort of thick rubber protective sheath where it meets the speaker housing. So as the cord bends it does not wear through to the metal wire. All in all not a bad little speaker and I would purchase it again."
,,aAnders Rundblad,good mono speaker for iphone or similar,16 Jun 2014,4.0 ,"this is a good mono speaker, Only negative is that the cord is a bit short. If you're looking into buying an iphone speaker you might want to spend a bit more and get a blue tooth speaker.Skip the cord connection completely. This speaker does have good sound, a lot of bass and is duarable."

I came across this one and decided to go with it based on the excellent reviews. I don't know a thing about electronics, but I can tell you this has pretty amazing sound for the size and cost. I am very pleased. It sounds good, it's small, and very inexpensive. My husband was impressed, as well - he asked me to go back and purchase one for him, too. Another great thing is that it doesn't eat up the batteries."
,,MindyHB,Best travel speakers,05 Sep 2014,5.0 ,Best travel speakers! I've used for years and still going strong
,,Lewisl,Great product,11 Aug 2014,5.0 ,Purchased this for a close friend who travels a lot. He uses it all the Time.
,,Robert Mendes,LOUD AND CLEAR!!!,08 Oct 2013,5.0 ,"LOUD! Nice and clear, did i say LOUD! Using it with a pbx device for ghost hunting. No problems so far."
,,eric oconnor,Arrived not working,28 Aug 2013,1.0 ,If the one I received worked I could write a better product review. The plug that went into the mp3 player would not make proper contact to play the music you had to wiggle the connection around. I thought it was the player so I grabbed my ipod and phone and it did the same for those. I returned it. It may be a great speaker but only if it works.
,,Gichurl Sung,Great sound quality for portable speaker!,25 Nov 2011,5.0 ,I have used previous model of this and I bought this because of satisfaction on previous one. The speaker sounds incredibly good. Literally unbelievable. Feels like the low and high are bit cut but overall sound is awesome! Best among other portable speaker types. Don't forget to on/off cause it might run out batteries in standby. The best sound range is middle of the table around 3~4 people sitting down.
,,Zac,Great product! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,01 May 2015,5.0 ,Beyond excellent sound quality. Works perfectly with iPhone and Spirit Box PSB-7. Crystal clear sound and amazing volume.
,,Donna Matheson,speakers,14 Aug 2013,5.0 ,This is a wonderful device. It is so easy to use and of course very portable. Iget a lot of use from it!
,,Robert,This speaker is a joke,06 Jan 2015,2.0 ,Spend the extra money and buy a good portable speaker
,,T. New,Five Stars,13 Mar 2015,5.0 ,loud impressive for size
,,Yin Wu,Five Stars,19 Jun 2015,5.0 ,"Thanks,"
,,CE Lloyd,Good Quality Speaker,19 Apr 2012,4.0 ,"For what it is, this little speaker performs quite well. Solid build and decent sound as long as you don't turn it up too high. Nice extension for my smart phone when playing tunes."
,,David Webb,Great sound for such a small speaker,30 Dec 2009,5.0 ,"This speaker has such an amazing sound for its size. It is great to take on vacation, or use around the house. I plug in my iPhone or iPod and have music where I am working or relaxing. Works great playing Pandora straight from the iPhone. The only downside I see is that I remove the batteries when I travel so that it does not accidentally turn on in my case/backpack."
,,Cloudyskies,On/Off button broken,02 Mar 2013,1.0 ,"As soon as I opened this thing, the on/off power button didn't work. It is just always ""on"", which makes the light stay on and drains the battery. So I always have to take a battery out when I'm not using it. And it is impossible to take it apart to try to fix it. Typical made in China JUNK! You would think they would have some quality control for the outrageous price!"
,,Ji,Great Speakers With Old Documents,18 Jan 2014,4.0 ,"The speakers are great and i specifically bought this model knowing its vintage since my friend has one which he bought like 5 or 6 years back, the manuals and documents that comes with it are all outdated, websites stated does not exist, promotions are not valid etc, so throw them away, no reason to get excited."
,,Jenny Penny,"good sound, long battery life",30 May 2009,4.0 ,"we're getting a lot of use out of this little speaker. have yet to replace the batteries. we use rechargeable AAA which usually don't go quite as long as standard alkaline. as others report, the connection of the rather thin audio input cable to the housing is just waiting to get strained. we wrapped a strong rubber band around the whole unit and run the cable through it as a strain relief. volumes won't rock the world. overall though, this thing was just what we were looking for to take the discman or ipod out gardening or around the bbq."
,,Amazon Customer,Bad design with short cable,15 Apr 2012,3.0 ,"Speakers sound great, but the short cord dangling in mid air from my iPad is just wrong. Had to order an extension cord. How could a speaker company such as AL create such a stupid design? And I see that they haven't changed this in their new models either. I just hope the extension doesn't degrade the sound. Also batteries do not last 12 hours as stated in the description."
,,blatantdanno,Great gift.,29 Jul 2013,5.0 ,"Purchased these for my mother on her birthday. it is a toss up between battery life and sound quality. As in, the battery life I do wish was better, but the sound quality is So Good, who cares... She loves it and uses her iPod with it while working outside. You will be amazed with the quality of this product, it being durable and sound quality."
,,Anne E.,Five Stars,12 Jul 2014,5.0 ,Great for the deck if you do not want a large dock. sound is good
,,Henry Anderson,might be discontinued but still sound great,21 Oct 2014,4.0 ,Just recived my orbit speaker. Put batteries in turn it on. Plugged into my phone tunes sounded great. Have an older tv pluged it into the earphone jack . Works & sounds really good. Only problem short phone jack cord. Need to find an extension.
,,RL,Nice so far,01 Dec 2011,5.0 ,"Great little speaker for the price, probably about the best sounding in it's class too. It's a little bigger than other similar units (~3.5"" diameter), but is still small enough to completely grasp in my hand. And I will sacrifice smaller size to get better sound. My only concern is how long a fresh set of batteries will last and if this thing will hold up over time."
,,Brian Cianfrani,altec im-237,28 Feb 2009,3.0 ,The speaker blew out. We like the sound of the bigger model but on that speaker you have to turn the top to turn it on. And the big problem is that The wires always break. That's a big down fall.
,,Amazon Customer,Music on the go,08 Apr 2010,5.0 ,"The speaker is real easy just turn it on and plug it into the mp3. The sound quality is very good for what I listen to , which are lectures, Bible talks, and vocal music . It is small so I can carry it when I go travelling which is the main purpose I bought the speaker."
,,Zer09,over hyped defective speaker -overrated-,11 May 2013,2.0 ,"the audio has fine quality but even in light music @ 30-40% volume the speakers blow out into distortion, so loud which gradually damages the audio... extremely disappointed and upset... Altec Lansing iM-237 Orbit Ultraportable Speaker is so far overrated in my opinion maybe my replacement will speak for itself? requested for a replacement and got denied.. the seller did not listen to reason despite the warranty"
,,Roxsand F.,iM227 Altec Lansing,05 Dec 2011,5.0 ,"What a terrific product! For an item that cost me less than $20 including shipping, this turned out to be a big surprise in a tiny package. It's hardly bigger than the palm of a large hand, but the clear, undistorted sound is monster! This will be perfect for sharing my music on weekend get-aways; great for hotel rooms, lounging on the beach, working out in my home gym. The sound is crystal clear at all volume levels and super convenient for toting around to different places."
,,Amazon Woman,Altec Lanzing iM-237,12 Apr 2011,5.0 ,We have a lot of portable music & video players ranging from Android phones to Apples IPad. We've gone through many portable speakers & this is the best one I've used so far. Surprisingly loud and clear for it's size and very portable.
,,Rodney,Great little speaker!,28 Mar 2011,5.0 ,Pluses...great sound! I was at the pool in Hawaii playing Hawaiian music on my IPOD and people couldn't believe the sound was coming from the little speaker. Notso pluses (but not real negatives) The button for turning it on could be a little larger (maybe an oblong button?) as I have bigger fingers and the cord could be a little longer (but then it wouldn't fit in the storage) so like I said...not real negatives.
,,Jerry Nepon-sixt,"For what you pay, it's a nice little speaker....",08 May 2013,4.0 ,...but it lacks any real punch. I use it as a speaker on my bike so I can have music on the road and not have earbuds.
,,Dirty Sanchez,Lil speaker,12 Dec 2012,5.0 ,I'm very impressed with the quality of sound from this hockey puck. Have not tested the other speakers in this category but I doubt you'll find better sound.
,,BracDiver,Pretty good sound quality,16 May 2013,4.0 ,This is a great little portable speaker. The only negative I can say is I wish the battery life was a little better.
,,SlimBay,Two of these have broken on me,25 Jul 2011,1.0 ,I don't understand how this speaker is getting these rave reviews--TWO of them have gone sour on me. Within just a couple of weeks both suddenly went into a high-pitched squawking mode that wouldn't stop till I took the batteries out.
,,L. Rea,Excellent speaker,20 Aug 2010,5.0 ,"Wow. This is a terrific little speaker! The sound quality is great, it's easy to use, and the battery life is LONG. I always use Duracells; the manual says battery life is 24 hours, but I know it's more than that! LOVE THIS SPEAKER!!!"
,,maxwelljr,Horrible,08 Dec 2012,1.0 ,"I bought this speaker not to long ago, it is now not working. After a while, it gives off a VERY loud high pitch shreaking sound. Since I didn't save the receipt figuring what could go wrong with a speaker, I'm stuck with it. Now I have been looking for another speaker."
,,Joyce I Robinson,Five Stars,18 May 2015,5.0 ,works great
,,Sharon Tiahrt,Five Stars,21 Nov 2014,5.0 ,Very easy to use and great big sound!
,,Paul,Outstanding Speaker!,20 Apr 2010,5.0 ,"An outstanding little speaker that kicks out a lot of rich clear sound in the apartment, office or even on the deck. I use mine with my Palm Pre--- excellent value and construction! I have 3 of them!"
,,J. Dionne,Don't waste your money on this device,18 Jul 2012,1.0 ,"This speaker is horrible. It lacks a volume control, and if I raise the volume on my device (cell phone, iPod, AM/FM portable radio) more than half way the speaker starts to crackle badly, less than half volume and the speaker must be very close to hear it. Save your money, don't buy this product. I just replaced this speaker with the X-Mini. I use this piece of junk as a paper weight now."
,,Tennisman,love it!!,24 May 2010,5.0 ,it arrived right on time and the quality of the music playing from this altec lansing speaker... its just amazing! i love it... it's going to be really handy and very useful for me when i go to camp this summer. the sound is awesome.. when you set your computer volume to 90% and plug this altec lansing speaker.. you'll get twice the volume.. i would recommend to others who are looking to buy this.
,,Matthew Ogan,Good For Voice Recordings,04 May 2012,4.0 ,Suprisingly wide frequency response. No volume control and not very loud when used with a SanDisk Fuze. My main use of this item is for audio book playback in an outdoor environment.
,,J. West,Great little speaker ***UPDATE***,30 Apr 2011,2.0 ,"Works great and surprisingly good bass response. Very satisfied. Not sure about battery life yet, just got it and through in used batteries. **UPDATE** after about 2 months the batteries would not stay in, the coil that connects to the negative side of the battery would become loose and batteries would not stay connected. Very poor quality, not happy."
,,eight08trapps,best portable speaker for the price,27 Sep 2012,5.0 ,"when looking for a portable speaker i went through many that where to expensive. i came across the altec lansing im227 orbit and was blown away by the reviews, so i decided to give it a shot. all i can say is that it is the best speaker for the price along with the clarity. i would highly recommend this sell as well as the product."
,,Ron White,Good speaker for the size.,06 Jun 2015,5.0 ,Uses triple A batteries. Seems to last a long time. Sound quality is very good for the size.
,,Phloyd,Awesome little speaker with HUGE sound...,27 Feb 2012,5.0 ,"This is a great speaker whos price is just right for the decerning gentleman. I got mine for less then 20 bucks and the sound is great. No rechargable batteries to go dead on you, just change them and go. Big sound out of a small speaker, makes cell phone calls audible for those who are straining to hear cell calls from the inhouse speaker phone. I would buy this again for friends and family!!! (In fact I did!! lol)"
,,Franny,Great,22 Mar 2012,5.0 ,"Great for the money. Perfect for my iPad, iPhone and other phones. Well worth every penny. Great sound. I didn't expect much. I was suprised"
,,Donna Pineau,Great Little Speaker!!,03 Feb 2012,5.0 ,I purchased this speaker a couple of years ago. I love it. I've been very happy with it. It's compact so you can take it anywhere. I've taken it to the pool so I can listen to my iPod and I use it to get better sound while watching a movie or show on my computer. Great accessory!!
,,Health and Fitness Enthusiast,Perfect,04 Apr 2012,5.0 ,"I have had this for almost a month and it works great the sound is clear, and you can hear everything in your music, I even noticed things I couldn't hear with the cheap headphones that came with my mp3 player. Next thing to do is to buy another one and play both at the same time. Battery life is also real good, i recommend buying the Sanyo rechargeable batteries(and battery charger), they work great and last long with this product."
,,Bill Staley,"Amazing for its size and price, but mono and a little muddy",23 Sep 2009,3.0 ,"I wanted a good speaker for my iPod in hotel rooms. I have a Bose portable sounddeck, but that's too big and heavy to travel. (Sounds awesome, though.) I got the iHome iH29 and the Altec Lansing iM237 (one speaker). I received as a gift a Brookstone Ultra-Thin Travel Speaker. The iM237 is amazing for its size, price, weight (under 8 oz. with batteries) and sound quality. If those are your criteria, get it. Sound distorts a little at high volume (which is not all that loud). Good for spoken word (since it's pretty clear and it's mono not stereo). Batteries last a surprisingly long time. Cord is annoyingly short, but it packs up into a very compact package. Improves the sound of a Macbook Air very noticeably for music and spoken word. The iH29 sounds much better, with stereo making a noticeable difference and the tone of instruments sounding more defined, less muddy. The iH29 weighs 1 pound 10 oz. with its batteries but without its charger. It's heavy, but zips closed, so it travels well. The cord and charger/transformer do not fit into the zipped unit, though. The iH29 costs three times the price of the iM237. The iH29 charges the iPod -- if the iH29 is plugged into the wall outlet. The iM237 does not charge the iPod, so you would need to travel with an iPod charger or at least the USB cord to charge the iPod from your computer. (It would still be a very light set-up.) The Brookstone is the lightest with the slimmest profile. It is also mono. The Brookstone does not sound very good and tends to buzz noticeably if the volume is turned up. The Brookstone does not charge the iPod. It folds shut but does not zip. It needs a cord to connect to the iPod, and the cord can't stay connected to the unit when traveling, so you would want a rubber band around it to keep the cord with it. The iM237 has a zip bag that makes a package as big as a man's fist. The Brookstone is the size of a thin, small paperback book. The iH29 is a dense, oddly formed thing, maybe the size (when closed and zipped) of two big fists and two child's fists -- but it sure sounds good. None of them sound as good as the Bose, so get that for home, if you can."
,,Espana,Orbit Speaker,02 Jun 2013,4.0 ,The product is perfect. It lived up to the review. I am very happy with it. Can be used for anything that has a speaker port.
,,V. Garza,it didnt work,09 Jan 2011,1.0 ,"I got this in October based on the reviews and portability and it worked great the first 5 times or so. After that when when I put it on it would play a little music and then go into very loud static sound. I changed the batteries but it is still doing that. I am only sorry it didnt work for me, I must have gotten a bad one. The sound quality is really good when it works."
,,Kindle Customer,Perfect for travelling,19 Oct 2010,5.0 ,"Was looking for a small external speaker system to connect with my I-Pod. This is small enough that it takes very little room in the suitcase, but yet, when plugged in, fills the room with music. Loud enough and small enough, but big on sound! Love it!! And the price was very affordable. Highly recommend it."
,,T. Kruse,Small but mighty!,06 Jan 2009,5.0 ,"My husband got this speaker for me to use with my iPod around the house, traveling or camping.The sound is impressive! It is lightweight and small. I got one for my son-in-law to use with his iPod when he works out at home. They took it in their restored 70's Ford Bronco, which is pretty loud, and the sound was great. I can't say enough!"
,,Rucanor X,ALOT of sound for a smaller speaker,26 Apr 2011,5.0 ,"To be honest, I'm really surprised how clear and loud this speaker is for the size. The case it came with fit it like a glove, it takes less batteries than the iHome I have (3 AAA instead of 4 AAA) and lasts WAY longer. I take this with me when staying at hotels and otherwise in case they dont have anything to hook up to in the room and still am on the original batteries several months later. Yet another great value for the money - recommended for sure."
,,Amazon Customer,Neato little speaker,19 Jul 2009,5.0 ,"This thing is fantastic! We have gotten tons of remarks about how good this sounds for the tiny little thing it is. Lots of bass compared to other portables, and the batteries are lasting a long time."
,,Aly Kate,Great speaker!!,02 Jan 2012,5.0 ,Small but powerful! This handy little speaker travels with me all over the place. It puts out a mighty sound and works like a charm. The only complaint I have would be that the cord is only about 3 or 4 inches long and there was room around the base to make a longer cord. But other than that I am very very pleased with this and would order it again!
,,texasperk,not quite as loud as i wanted but the sound is good.,04 Aug 2014,3.0 ,"Still works, not quite as loud as i wanted but the sound is good."
,,Longhorn,Great Product,10 Jun 2012,4.0 ,"This speaker simply works! Plug it in, turn in on and be amazed. This is perfect for giving just that extra boost in sound for your iPad or iPhone. My only complaint is that the cord is only about 8 inches, which is a bit short. All in all, a good buy."
,,Amazon Customer,Pretty good portable speaker,10 Jun 2011,4.0 ,"Works as described. The sound is ok considering it's small size. It is much easier to operate than the previous version, just push the on button. On the previous model you had to twist the top to turn on and off. This new model isn't as compact as the previous model. I think the prevous model sounded better and I liked the smaller size of the old one, which was slightly larger in diameter and shorter, this made the old one easier to pack and carry around."
,,S. Korpal,perfect,06 Mar 2009,5.0 ,Love this little speaker! It has great sound with very little distortion (except on the very heavy bass songs of course). I work in an area with alot of noise and this works for my music needs.
,,Richard De La Torre,Don't believe the hype,15 Mar 2012,2.0 ,"Don't believe the hype. The volume on these things aren't all that, and they are terrible battery hogs. Would not recommend."
,,A. Rattigan,"Great Price, Greater Sound!",20 Jun 2011,5.0 ,This little speaker is SO worth the money! The sound that comes from this little thing is amazing! You would think there are two speakers set up with a bass boost. Perfect for our Android phone...great to travel with!!!
,,Dennis,Five Stars,06 Aug 2015,5.0 ,Impressive......
,,dssnyder,little rocker,26 Mar 2012,4.0 ,"i'll second most of the reviews i've read in that the cord to this speaker is very short. that doesn't take away from the positives for me regarding this little dynamo. i'll be using this speaker all around the house, garage, etc. later this spring, i'll take it with me to the beach to rock. i did read a review where an individual bought a second speaker and hooked it up with a splitter. i'm doing the same and expect to be jamming in true stereo!"
,,JC,Four Stars,29 Jul 2015,4.0 ,sounds great
,,A. Fuller,Amazing speaker.,11 Sep 2011,5.0 ,"Great quality sound for a great price. I bought this little speaker because my laptop speakers are very quiet, even when turned up all the way. I just wanted something ultra portable with decent sound. This little speaker blew my mind. It sounds fantastic. I've used it everyday for a few weeks now and the batteries are still going strong. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a speaker like this."
,,shiite7,"Impressive sound, good construction quality",04 Jan 2011,5.0 ,"I am quite impressed with the sound quality of this guy and feel this is a steal at around 22 dollars. The ""soundbox"" around the speaker is well-built, very sturdy, and seems to help prevent any unintended rattling and at the same time improving sound quality/resonance. The sound quality is probably on par with 30 dollar earbuds. The bass is surprisingly strong. Highly recommended. The case is nice too."
,,Aldo Gutierrez Hemala,"Small but very powerful, I love it!",09 Aug 2010,5.0 ,"Small, portable, powerful. Is the best mini speaker I've ever own, great battery life, the sound is very clear with good base sound. Thanks Altec Lansing! I use it with the ipod touch and the BenQ Joybee GP1 Mini-LED DLP Projector and I have a portable home theater. CONS: Short cable, but I got ab extension. No volume button, but you can use the one on the MP3 player. But still I think is the best mini speaker in the market."
,,Charles B.,AAA Powered,05 Sep 2015,4.0 ,"The sound is pretty ""bright"" even compared with other devices in this class of ultra-portable speakers, but the fact that it uses AAA batteries makes it more easily repowered than those that charge from USB, which is good when on the go."
,,Richard Sharp,GREAT MEDIUM GRADE SPEAKERS,29 May 2013,5.0 ,"I love having the extra expansion and boost from the large subwoofer. Of course, it is only 2.1...but much superior to my Bose Companion II speakers. You will find that different settings work better for different playbacks, but it is easy to switch which setting you prefer for any particular music...it is worth the few extra dollars !"
,,Cristina Cannon,Altec Lansing iM-237Orbit Ultraportable Speaker for MP3 Players,20 Nov 2009,4.0 ,"I am very pleased to state the overall review of this clever little portable speaker suits all my purposes I looked for in this product type.I am not interested in a overwhelming powerful sound,rather in the practicality and sound finesse of the speaker.It's portable in every aspect.Suitable at any home or family gathering for background dinner music,at the beach if you are in a group,at the grillparty...etc.It is a great addition to my iTouch and I carry it to be able to listen to my kind of music."
,,larry richter,Four Stars,01 Dec 2014,4.0 ,Sound is good but cable is very flimsy-
,,Yankee Papa,Altec Lansing iM227 Orbit MP3 Speaker,12 Jan 2013,5.0 ,The sound reproduction for such a small speaker is very good and provides all the volume needed for my wife's iPod when she's not using earbuds. I'm getting another one for my iPod.
,,MCO,Great portable accesory,10 Nov 2010,5.0 ,"This is s terrific little, portable speaker for your ipod, mp3 player or in my case portable satellite radio. It works with any device that has a mini headphone jack. it is well built, comes with its own case and has rich full bodied sound. It does require 3 AAA batteries but i haven't even gone through my first set after several hours of use. All in all a great headphone replacement for a very reasonable price, about $20."
,,Kenneth Warner,Love these a LOT,28 Oct 2012,5.0 ,My wife and I have 2 of these little speakers now. Sound great for the size and battery life is way longer than expected.
,,Freddy,Handy,26 Dec 2014,3.0 ,Good little speaker
,,A Mom,Two Stars,26 Jun 2015,2.0 ,"Was great at first, but didn't last long. Quit working after a couple of months."
,,Baddfrog,I'd probably give this 5 stars if it had a volume adjustment on it and didn't crackle a bit at the high volume levels.,10 Apr 2013,4.0 ,"I wanted to rate this when I got it because it worked so well...but figured anything could work well for a short time. So I waited...and then forgot. :) Now I am going back and rating this knowing that it has worked great for over a year. I would have no problems recommending this to someone else, and would definitely buy another one."
,,Edward Przystas,Amazing,03 Aug 2012,5.0 ,This little jewel is amazingly powerful. I just love it. Had to return the first one and they were great. Got me a replacement in no time. Returned because to on off button kept getting stuck. A minor product flaw.
,,Afit,Excellent sound from this little speaker,06 Jan 2013,5.0 ,"Bought two of these speakers, one for each of my kids ages 11 and 13. They like playing music from their ipads and wanted a portable yet powerful speaker that lets them connect without having to remove their ipad covers. This was it. Both kids love it and the quality for a battery run portable gadget is amazing. So affordable too, highly recommend for tweens & teens."
,,Karen Masuda,"Great ""little"" product!",15 Oct 2010,5.0 ,"I saw this at my son's place and the sound was so ""big"" coming from such a little thing. And the quality of the sound was great. So I bought one. The first one I received was defective. The on-off button was loose so it wouldn't stay on. But the return/exchange process was so fast and smooth. In no time at all, I received a new one and it is awesome! I love how portable it is with great sound quality. This is definitely one of the best things I've bought this year. Thanks!"
,,Dafne Caruso,Great for the money,11 Apr 2011,5.0 ,"I had one of these previously, lost it and replaced it with this purchase. It is a great speaker, great sound, and perfect for the traveler because of it's size. It only requires on AAA battery which lasts a long time."
,,:-)),Nice portable inexpensive speaker,15 Nov 2011,5.0 ,"Not a 200 watts speaker, but nice base,nice mid range,compact,comfortable listening next to your desk or spa, a lot better than some of the $50 speakers I have owned previously. If Altec Lansing could squeeze in micro SD and volume control, they would have an unbeatable product."
,,Robert H.,Five Stars,28 Jan 2015,5.0 ,Great!
,,Bradley Mast,We use it all the time.,29 Jan 2014,5.0 ,"If you want a realistic sounding mono speaker to go with an iPod at a decent price, this is a good choice. The batteries seem to last a long time. It does not have the bass of a speaker like BassBoomz but it is half the price."
,,Jill Griffith,Little Speaker,07 Jun 2011,4.0 ,"This little speaker is great! It has good sound. I have it play directly from my Droid, just plug in and away it goes. The only thing I recommend is that you do not have the sound all the way up on the phone, it will distort your music a bit. Otherwise I think it is a great buy. I use it out at the beach and at our sand volley ball games, which are wide open. Everyone on the court can hear the music!"
,,Hayden Lindsey,WARNING -- NO 2.5 mm adapter; NO batteries included,12 Feb 2009,4.0 ,"This is a nice speaker; my wife believes it sounds better than the built-in speakers in my Apple Macbook Pro laptop. However, the product description is inaccurate: the package does NOT include the 2.5 mm adapter, nor the AAA batteries. The box clearly says that no adapter included, and no batteries are included. Amazon made the missing adapter right for me, though. But they need to fix this product description."
,,db,Great Sound for the Money!,08 Oct 2013,5.0 ,"This small speaker has good sound quality, and for the cost, it would be hard to beat. Absolutely no complaints."
,,C. Long,Great little speaker,22 Mar 2012,5.0 ,"Bought this puppy to take on trips and use my phone as an MP3 Player. The 3 AAA btteries seems to last past 12 hours, sounds great for being only 1 little speaker and very happy with it. Only con is that the cord is rather short."

,,boseli,Amazing little speaker!,17 Feb 2010,5.0 ,"Great item; I have purchased three so far. Two for gifts, one for me after hearing such good things from my sons when I gave them one of these little guys. Great portability and amazing sound for such a little thing."
,,chitownn,Perfect speaker!!,11 Apr 2012,5.0 ,"I am a huge music lover and wanted a boost for the music apps on my phone. This speaker is great and use it while in the shower, at the beach, and just about everywhere on the road. Great speaker for the money."
,,JosephJ,Works great,12 Sep 2013,5.0 ,"Plugs in simply, batteries last pretty good amount of time and about a month if you just leave them in there. I used this for the SB7 spirit box and world of a difference compared to built in speaker. I also use it for my RT-EVP 2. I don't go anywhere without it because I even catch myself using for my cell phone."
,,enchantress,worked for 5 months,18 Dec 2012,2.0 ,"This worked fine for 5 months, then wouldn't turn on anymore. I'm not sure if I'll be able to exchange it."
,,amauris,ALTEC LANGSING,03 Oct 2011,4.0 ,"At first I was not expecting too much out of this small speaker, but after plugging it to my computer it easily outperfomed the ones I already had. So I decided to use it instead of the ones I had before. The sound is superb. It is a pity it has no built in volume control but the sound compensates for this small inconvenience."
,,Joe,Two Stars,07 Feb 2015,2.0 ,"Good sound, but not sure why the cord is so short"
,,william erckman,Five Stars,02 Nov 2015,5.0 ,Great little speaker

,,BStevens,Great Things Come In Small Packages!!,16 Apr 2010,5.0 ,"I was looking for a small portable speaker for my iPod and checked out several. I read the reviews on this one and did a little more research on the web. Ultimately I purchased it from Amazon (Great Price + Free Shipping)and waited for it to arrive. I am very, very happy with this little speaker. Good Construction and Great Sound!! It may be a little large for some of you but the sound quality and range more than makes up for it's size. Bottom Line: Love It!!"
,,kathy caldwell,Five Stars,27 Sep 2014,5.0 ,expensive!! but great
,,Nicholas R. Keller,Great Product,11 Nov 2011,5.0 ,"This product works great as long as you dont get too loud with the volume on your ipod. if you get to loud with it it will get very staticy just remember to keep the volume at mid level but this only happens with the ipod, other mp3 players have more of a limited volume, other than that its a great speaker."
,,Satish,I like this,18 Oct 2011,5.0 ,"I bought this to basically listen to Podcasts on my phone. And this speaks serves the purpose. The voices are clear and crisp. I did not test the speaker with any music. In real, this is bigger than in the pictures. Diameter is about 7.5 cms and the thickness is about 4.5 cms. The build is solid. I wish the length of the chord is little longer."
,,Charlie E.,Great sound in a compact package,02 May 2010,5.0 ,"Great sound in a compact package. When compared to other wireless speakers, this unit is inexpensive and gets the job done. If you want a speaker to use on your patio or poolside, this is the unit to get."
,,Jeff,Four Stars,22 Jul 2015,4.0 ,Good sound
,,Wayno,Great Little Speaker with Good Sound,19 Mar 2010,5.0 ,"I bought the speaker for powerpoint presentations for my laptop and I am very satisfied. The only negative on this speaker is that the cord to plug the speaker into the laptop is too short. Since the speaker jack input is in the middle of the front of the laptop, I have to put the speaker in front of the laptop or on top of the laptop next to the keys. If the cord was a little longer, I could move the speaker to the side of the laptop and not be in the way."
,,Joe B. Miller,Great sound,19 Jun 2010,5.0 ,"It let me set-up my potable DVD player where more than a person could watch AND listen. For the little bit of money this costs, it's well worth the money!!!"
,,Gigabyte__1024,Best little speaker ever!!!!!,18 Jan 2012,5.0 ,"this little thing is loud. It will fill your room with crisp, clear, sound. It is so energy efficient, you're forget it has batteries. I put 3 AAA rechargeable batteries in it and they work perfectly!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,,dicter44,Spectacular,16 Aug 2010,5.0 ,"This is a remarkable speaker. How they did it, I don't know and don't much care. The quality of sound it produces from my iPod is incredible. I purchased it for a trip to Italy, and am entirely satisfied. If you're looking for Bose quality sound then stay at home and sit in front of your stereo. If, however, you want something to take with you on your travels that can fill a room with quality sound, give this speaker a serious look...or listen. You won't be disappointed."
,,Audata,Impressive sound in a compact speaker,14 Dec 2008,5.0 ,"I use the iM-237 to listen to my iPod when parked (I work a lot out of my ""office on wheels"") so I don't deplete my car's battery. Spoken word recordings sound about as good as they do through my car's speaker system. Music sounds good too, with a strong base sound for its size. It's great for audiobooks and podcasts anywhere."
,,netsirkd,Very Low Volume on Droid X,18 Feb 2011,1.0 ,This product seemed to be exactly what I wanted until I used it. I have a Droid X and the volume of this speaker was very low. I had to turn the volume of the Droid to max just to get any kind of volume out of this speaker. The sound from the Droid is better than this speaker. I tried a new set of batteries just in case the ones that come with it were weak. I am returning and looking for something else.
,,Kay B. Jones,"sounds good, and does not eat batteries",11 Jan 2015,5.0 ,"Have had one for one year. Continues to work well on a daily basis, sounds good, and does not eat batteries. Recently bought a second one for my wife."

,,Phillip,If you are looking for a great price and great sound for your laptop or ipod ...,10 Sep 2014,4.0 ,This little speaker packs a major punch for its size . Cost and quality are superb by far . If you are looking for a great price and great sound for your laptop or ipod this is a perfect fit ... very happy with this purchase !
,,Dan Gwiazdon,Very poorly designed battery compartment. Didn't work right out ...,01 Jun 2015,1.0 ,"Very poorly designed battery compartment. Didn't work right out of the box. I had one previously with the exact same problem, batteries don't make contact unless you wedge a piece of aluminum foil in between the unit and battery."
,,Joseph G.,Powerful small speaker,10 Sep 2011,5.0 ,"This little speaker has a lot of bang for your buck. It has a standard headphone connector and a power button. It comes with a case to keep it nice and safe too. This little speaker has very nice sound quality and a lot of boom for its small size. It's a very good speaker and it'll be your best friend on the beach, in the bathroom when youre in the shower, wherever you need a small portable speaker this little guy will be your best friend."
,,Sheep,This is a great little speaker,09 Sep 2014,5.0 ,"This is a great little speaker. We have been using it for over a year, and it still works well."
,,David Schmid,"Good build, good sound.",07 Jul 2013,4.0 ,"It doesn't actually sound much louder than an ipad or laptop speakers at first, but the quality and projection is enough better that it makes a big difference. The headphone jack is really short, so keep that in mind. Otherwise, small and classy!"
,,A. Gift For You,"Haven't had it long, but works well",31 Dec 2009,4.0 ,"Sound is surprisingly strong and clear. Not much bass, but what can you expect from something this small. Would have liked for the price to be a little lower, but wasn't too high. All in all a good product for not a lot of money. If you want high end quality with a lot of bass you'll be spending some bucks."
,,Matthew Meiron,Great sound,09 Dec 2012,4.0 ,"Great sound and bass. This thing is loud for just a small speaker. Lasts quite a while before batteries need replaced. 30-40 hours I would guess. great little speaker to amplify iphone at work, campsite, frisbee golfing, etc. i would recommend for sure."
,,musicguru,AWESOME! So great I got another one...,25 Nov 2011,5.0 ,"This speaker is amazing! I bring it everywhere with me, and people always ask me where I got it. I had one for a couple years and I dropped it on a wooden floor and it stopped working, but I couldn't survive without it so I ordered another one. The sound quality is excellent and it goes up very loud (I never need to turn it up all the way). It's so tiny, portable and light it's really easy to pack and bring with me. It's great!"
,,eblu,Fantastic sound quality; works sporadically (defective?),05 Jan 2016,3.0 ,"About two weeks into using this product very casually and in the same place..it started to work only sporadically. However, when it does work the sound quality is fantastic."
,,txdurk,Perfect size and very good sound.,14 Oct 2014,5.0 ,Nice unit. Perfect size for carrying with good quality sound.
,,Rebeqa Hubart,good purchase decision,12 Sep 2014,5.0 ,"Love this thing, it's worked wonders for me and this is the second one I've had, only because my cat knocked it off the counter and busted it. But this is a good buy."
,,malka,Never even turned on...,05 Jun 2013,1.0 ,"I was so excited to get this product, but I guess I got a faulty one. The batteries are brand new, and everything looks fine, except that the thing won't work at all. There is no power light, and no sound at all. When I hit the power button, I hear a click and nothing else. Hope the rest of you have better luck!"
,,Bill W.,Love this speaker,03 Aug 2011,5.0 ,This is the second one I ordered. My son borrowed my first one and won't give it back.I use rechargeable aaa batteries in my mp3 player and the speaker. They last a long time. My only complaint is that the cord should be longer.
,,Disappointed,"Good Potential, but Disappointing",28 Jul 2010,2.0 ,"After returning the first one, we were sure this one would work. However, after 2 songs played, there was a loud static hum sounding like the speakers were blown. This was the same problem we experienced with the prior one. This problem occurred even though we had a low volume set on our I-Pod. The concept for this product is great. We travel quite a bit and were excited about the portability. We are now very disappointed that we can't get rid of the static."
,,Gwen Nest,Super Speaker!,09 Jun 2012,5.0 ,"I bought this for my portable dvd player which isn't quite loud enough if there is any other noise in the environment. This little speaker is impressive, loud and clear! I also bought a 3' stereo extension cord so I could set the speaker closer to me than the dvd player. Also, it takes a few AAA batteries, instead of rechargeable - a perfect option for camping. Can't beat for the price."
,,Floataboat,Nice sound for the bux...,20 Mar 2015,4.0 ,Nice inexpensive speaker to use w/laptop and MP3 player. I would prefer that the On/Off switch be on top of the unit. Also. be careful of the different volume settings on your devices!
,,M. Zinn,About Time,18 Nov 2011,5.0 ,"What a great speaker. We've been looking for a battery powered speaker for several years, and they all seem to be very expensive, very bulky, or just terrible sounding. This one is the real deal. Plenty small and light and the sound is just great. Nothing fancy, no volume control, just the one speaker, but it puts out plenty of sound. Just a great item."
,,A. Peake,Great Ipod or Laptop speaker,06 Jul 2010,5.0 ,"This little speaker packs a wallop. Sound quality is good, no distortion even at full volume. The order was filled and shipped quickly. Good merchant."
,,Ross,Altec Lansing iM227 Orbit MP3 Speaker on off button,08 Jul 2012,3.0 ,Love the speaker for size but the sound is to low and the on off button is not working properly i wish i could have given more stars but that's what i classify it as to me. The sound isn't much louder than the kindle fire and the button you have to click many times for it to stay on sorry i couldn't give better review
,,bamboo2112,great sound,06 Oct 2011,5.0 ,I purchased this to use with my sansa 2gig clip. The sound is excellent with very brilliant highs and nicely pronounced lows. I really like that it does not weigh much so it can be easily taken anywhere.
,,stargazer,"SMALL SPEAKER, BIG SOUND!!",24 Dec 2010,5.0 ,"This speaker has fab reviews for a reason, it rocks! Seriously, who knew a little speaker could pack this much punch? I'm buying 2 more!!"
,,MokaMommy,Does the job,28 Aug 2011,5.0 ,"My laptop has terrible internal speakers and since I use it to watch movies while in the kitchen, I was in need of an external speaker. I wasn't looking for anything expensive and have to say I've been pleasantly surprised. Definitely worth the money! I have no problem hearing over background kitchen noises/kids."
,,Crischelle Shank,round 2,25 Sep 2011,4.0 ,"After 2 years of playing the life out of the older Altec Lansing Orbit, it finally died (corroded battery area)and I picked up this one. Compact, light-weight, amazing volume and sound balance for such a small speaker! Delighted with it except that it doesn't come with the cover+clip the old one did, so a bit more tricky to take on camping trips. This has traveled 3 continents anyway and still sounds great. I easily recommend it!"
,,M. Seitz,basic speaker,31 Jan 2012,3.0 ,"If you are looking for a very simple speaker, this is the product for you. It is battery powered and the cable is short for the audio device you are connecting. There are no volume controls on the device itself."
,,Lauri,"Little, nice and powerful.",21 Feb 2011,5.0 ,"Perfect little speaker that sounds great. I am one of those people that over research items I want to buy. Defiantly not a waste of money, I bought two. One for me and one for my partner. Would recommend!"
,,Daniel,Awesome product,21 Dec 2011,5.0 ,"I bought the Philips SPA5210B/27 Notebook SoundBar for my laptop once I found out I erroneously bought a laptop without harman-kardon speakers (laptop speakers are a priority for me) and this product for my mp3 player and my cellphone. Cutting to the chase, I now use my laptop with this speaker, as well as my mp3 and my phone... I even bring it to work and plug it in the company's phones when we have a call meeting... it is just that good. I would buy it again, that is the best I can say for it."
,,Stephanie Calvert,Great little speaker!,10 Aug 2011,5.0 ,"I bought this to take on a trip and it worked out perfectly! I ended up using it on my laptop and ipod to watch tv and movies and listen to music, and the sound filled up a room. It's a lot of bang for your buck. I purchased it after reading it's reviews and so far, I'm very please. the battery life (running on three AAA batteries) seems to last a long time too. Overall it's a purchase I would make again."
,,K. Say,Love it!,21 Oct 2009,5.0 ,"I bought this for my son's ipod nano and it works great. It is very portable, small and has a nice carrying case. I also use it for my laptop, the speakers with my laptop are not the greatest and this little speaker makes such a difference. The sound is 360 degrees. It does not get super loud, but it does a fine job."
,,Cliff Ashbridge,Best Portable Speaker!,20 Jun 2010,5.0 ,"This little speaker is everything it is advertised to be. Lightweight, great sound and good price. Now I can use it with my litte TV, my MP3 and my cell phone. I think it is just great!"
,,travis,great sound long battery life,04 Jul 2012,5.0 ,This product was a great purchase. The sound quality is great and the battery is 15 hours plus when hooked up to my phone. I would and have reccomended this product to my friends and family.
,,Alexandre,everlasting portable mono speaker,14 Oct 2010,5.0 ,"Seven months of full, extensive usage (on iPod and MBP, randomly). SEVEN! No batteries been changed! Will it die, ever? Keep on going and going and going! Mono sound speaker at its best! Highly recommend, if you're on the GO! Definitely!"
,,Kindle Customer,Helping me better hear notebook and kindle and iphone with low tones ...,22 Jul 2015,5.0 ,This is well worth the money. Helping me better hear notebook and kindle and iphone with low tones that do not always carry well in outside environments.
,,shakyacres,Nice speaker for the price,09 Aug 2012,5.0 ,"The product was received promptly. The sound really is sufficient given price, the portability, and convenience of having a battery operated speaker. Only complaint is the flimsy nature of the cord between the speaker and the jack."
,,Jordan Feldstein,Exactly what you want (better than you'd expect) from portable speakers,22 Jul 2009,4.0 ,"Much louder than lappy speakers: Check. Can rage your ipod: Check. Perfectly acceptable sound quality: Check (If you want fantastic speakers... why are you looking at a 30$ portable mono unit? Get real) At least 5 hrs playback on 3 AAA's: Check. Seriously, 30$ ? Awesome. Buy them now, throw them in your backpack. You'll find times to use them and you'll be happy you have it."
,,Craig Garver,Blew the Speaker in a week,15 May 2010,3.0 ,"Good sound, fits perfect in my cup holder while working a delivery route with no radio. good for the price, only complaints are that u cannot play music very loud on it. this is ment for quieter environments, like a small office not a noisy truck where i have to play music loud. I could see where in the future if i did not blow the speaker the cable probably would have gone bad and theres no port to plug in your own cable."
,,Filia Slayer,"Love, Love, LOVE it!",15 Dec 2010,5.0 ,"The sound quality is terrific! I just received my product and am already head over heels for this. Granted this is only my second portable speaker since the iDog, but this is hands down the best one, and was around the same price. I did plenty of research before buying this one, and am so glad. There's no static in mines, even when setting the volume to the max. The sound is crisp and sharp unlike the others. A great birthday present to myself. ^_^"
,,sheryl grove,"Superb speaker at low, low price",27 Mar 2013,5.0 ,"Altec Lansing Orbit MP3 speaker. I am very pleased with the superb quality of this speaker and the low price. Great for listening to audiobooks in the car or doing house or yard work, when earphones are annoying. It took me 15 minutes to get it out of its package, using a knife and kitchen shears. I resent that."
,,Nancy,MP3 Speaker,19 Oct 2012,5.0 ,Attaches to my mini pod AND my computer the sound is fantastic and so easy to carry around places. My dtr ordered it for me and now I have purchased several for friends!
,,Amazon Customer,Love it!!!,09 Apr 2011,5.0 ,Everyone I show this little beauty to wants one. It is so easy to use in the classroom with my students. I can easily take it to other classrooms and even outdoors. It has wonderful sound that can easily be heard throughout the classroom. It is the best $25 I've spent in a while. Only draw back is that the students want to play with it; preK students and electronics don't mix;-)
,,C. Frost,Bad Quality,04 Jul 2011,1.0 ,At first when I received this it worked fine. The sound quality was fine. I used it about two times before it started making a horrible screeching sound after the music started. Had to return since it doesn't work.
,,lindsey,Works as advertised,26 Oct 2011,4.0 ,This little speaker setup works great. It operates on batteries so you don't have to plug it in when you are out on the road. It is louder than the computer speakers and if you sit it on the right stuff the sound is amplified very well. You just have to remember to shut it off when not in use. It is small enough not to be intrusive either. There is no volume control on it.
,,T. Anderson,Great Gift for Teenagers,17 Oct 2013,5.0 ,"We purchased several of these speakers as gifts for teenage relatives. All of a sudden, we were the ""cool"" aunt and uncle."
,,Joan,MP3 Speaker,27 Jan 2011,5.0 ,"This speaker is the answer to my prayer. My car is not equipped for any MP3, so I could not use it for trips. My daughter found this and gave it to me for Xmas. I loved it so much, I ordered another one for myself. The sound is great. I also use it in my house, which is why I ordered the 2nd one. I can also hitch my cell phone up to it and that is a wonderful feature when traveling. And the cost is very reasonable."
,,Nicole N,Ultra loud buzzing after a few months.,07 Apr 2014,2.0 ,I loved this speaker until it sporadically interrupted my audio with ultra loud buzzing. It also occasionally did it when it wasn't turned on while I was trying to sleep. Changed batteries but no dice. Had to e-cycle it.
,,Poli.Nik,superb sound quality,30 Aug 2009,5.0 ,"The sound quality is amazing! It's small, compact and no frills. Worth noting, there is no volume control on the speaker, so all settings must be controlled through whatever mp3 device you're using - not a problem for me, but something someone might want to know. Only one button on the speaker: On/Off. I keep this one in my diaper bag and plug it into my cellphone and listen to music when at the park or when taking my son for a stroll. We love it!"
,,Kate,"High performance, low price",25 Jan 2012,5.0 ,"I was going to purchase the speaker currently being advertised on an infomercial but this site gave some great reviews and recommendations. I ordered the Altec Orbit Speaker and I am very happy with it. We received it quickly and it lives up to its reputation. We use it on the laptops and the phones to enhance music and even phone calls. Compact, battery operated. Great product."
,,bwdatx,"astounding product, great price.",20 Apr 2011,5.0 ,"What a great product. I picked this up for playing poolside and around the campfire. I can't comment on the battery life or durability of the product because I just got the speaker, but I can't say enough about the quality of the sound. I'll be going fishing on the river in a few weeks and can't wait to set this up in the boat!"
,,Track and Field Freak,Use it all the time!,14 May 2014,5.0 ,I use this all of the time. I use it with my ipod when I'm running in the pool to listen to my uptempo music. I also use it with my ipad when I'm cooking in my kitchen watching something on Netflix. I highly recommend this product!
,,RENFRO,Wonderful little product!!!,20 Sep 2010,5.0 ,"This is a great little speaker, with HUGE sound!! I am a delivery driver and have to load my truck every day. This speaker is perfect for the back of my truck. It is small and compact but has great sound quality and hooks up to my phone to listen to Pandora. It is a wonderful product!! The battery life is great. I have had it for a month now and havent changed the batteris yet! GREAT PRODUCT!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SPEAKER!!!"
,,Sophie K.,Portable and Produces Good Sound,15 Nov 2014,5.0 ,I've had this for a while and it still works great. Just the thing I need for when I want to hear better sound from my iPod. The size is also great to use on a trip.
,,Kindle Customer,Great speaker for iPhone or iPod!,11 Apr 2010,5.0 ,"This little speaker packs a pretty big punch. Sure, cranked full blast there's a bit of distortion but that's to be expected. The only downfall to this unit, and for me it's not even an issue, is, as some have commented, the short cord. Personally, it's not a problem as I use it with my iPhone and just set them next to each other anyway. Definitely worth the price."
,,Cmg,Very Portable Speaker,09 Jan 2010,4.0 ,"This is a small, light portable speaker. It does a good job for its size. It is meant to be a local speaker and it does a good job at that."
,,JulieF,Great speaker for my iPod,13 May 2011,5.0 ,"Great speaker -- makes a nice little portable ""Stereo"" system for my iPod. Impressed that it came with everything necessary to hook it up and listen right away. I can't always be bothered to use earbuds while listening to my iPod, and sometimes you want everyone to be able to listen, and this speaker makes that possible."
,,Jody M.,Five Stars,02 Aug 2014,5.0 ,Good little speaker that we still use today.
,,Lonnie Jones,Good product! Great sound quality.,10 Jul 2014,4.0 ,Great speakers. Very loud in the gym. Plug it up to any mp3 and the room fills up with music. Great product.
,,Michael R.,Great little speaker for your laptop or music device,06 Feb 2011,4.0 ,Great little speaker for your laptop or music device. I use this on deployments and it works great plus it is super portable.
,,Michael Krampitz,perfect,17 Feb 2014,5.0 ,"The service you provided me was great,I got the speaker in a timely manor and it works perfect for what I need it for.Infact If I can get some kind of double plug so I could plug another speaker in with it ,like a y jack I might get another one."
,,F. Maciuska,Great Sound in a little package,27 Aug 2009,5.0 ,"Purchased this for an upcoming trip. I hooked up my IPOD shuffle and was blown away by the quality of the sound. Very clear, no static and sounds like a much bigger system. I recommend this to anyone who wants to listen without headphones. I'm sure audiophiles will not share the same reaction, but for those that are less discrminating and want something that works, is convenient, and a no brainer to hook up and use-this meets the need."
,,killaeyez32,Five Stars,06 Oct 2015,5.0 ,good speaker
,,Lawrence Silvestri,Great Item Nasty Phone Service,01 Aug 2011,5.0 ,I love the Orbit the sound is great and it is very easy to carry anywhere. But I had a problem when the bottom ( that holds the batteries) fell off and was stepped on I called the people at Orbit and was connected to a very nasty service person He told me that they do not sell replacement parts and more or less I was screwed. I taped the bottom and it works fine but I did not like the way I was just blown off.
,,joe,Three Stars,10 Apr 2015,3.0 ,It's a good speaker. One thing though. NO volume control. One setting. That's it.
,,E. Sickels,perfect,04 May 2015,4.0 ,fun
,,yogachik,Perfect in every way,23 Jul 2010,5.0 ,"Being a yoga instructor, I find myself in places where a sound system is not available. I used to lug around a CD player. Now, all I have to do is carry this small speaker for my MP3 in my purse. I take it (almost) everywhere...classes, the pool, outside when I am working in the garden. It has great sound quality...better than expected. I would HIGHLY recommend this item to everyone looking for a portable speaker."
,,M. Welch,Loved it but it doesn't work,26 Jun 2011,2.0 ,Started out working fine then just died on me..Of course I changed the batteries and then it worked fine for about 3 minutes and died again. The green light stays on but no sound. I tried it with multiple mp3 players. I must have recieved a bad one so I will send it back. They are worth the money if they work based upon the limited playing I had with it.
,,Richi,Packs a Powerful Punch!,02 Nov 2011,5.0 ,This little guy is amazing for its size and price-- I was leery at first but decided to go with it over the more expensive ipod docking stations. I'm glad I did.
,,S. Pick,Junk,15 Jul 2012,1.0 ,This speaker has been a major disappointment. Not only is the chord stupidly short (had to get an extension) the speaker occasionally rips our ears off with static like 1000 fingernails on a blackboard. I'm tossing this piece of junk in the trash where it belongs.
,,Caliborn,"Prefect for backpacking; small, but puts out great sound!!!",28 Jun 2012,5.0 ,"Just got this the other day and I must say I'm impressed. It puts out great sound for it size and it very compact. I did my research on all the small speaker stereos, and this is the one I went for and I'm glad I did. It's no boombox but for what it is, it's perfect."
,,Kim,Awesome,11 Feb 2009,5.0 ,"I'd highly recommend this speaker to anyone. Small & portable, easy to use and GREAT sound coming from a little speaker - you'd be surprised."
,,J. Swall,Altec Portable Speaker,21 Nov 2010,5.0 ,Great little speaker. I use it for stroller walks/hiking. I have a 1 year old that loves to listen to music while we power walk on walking city trails. Also great while walking with my wife so we can talk and enjoy the music. Safer than walking with earbuds...can hear the others on the trail etc... J
,,P. H. Daniel,Terrific travel speaker,02 Nov 2009,5.0 ,"I mostly listen to audio books on the road and had some travel speakers that distorted badly. This speaker is terrific. The sound is deep and free of distortion. Music sounds great on it too, as long as you don't plan on cranking the volume to the max. You won't get stereo but you don't get that with two small travel speakers attached to each other anyway. Great product for what it does."
,,alex,superb,29 Sep 2011,4.0 ,"I buy this item and I'm surprised by its sound. Loud and clear, bass enough for its tiny size. Runs on AAA battery, it makes easier to be replaced. One things that should be here is the capability to take electric from other sources, USB or AC adaptor. It will make perfect. Like dizzzz :)"
,,CASEY,Surprising Fidelity...,14 Jan 2014,5.0 ,Luv this little thing... - Truly cool sound for this tiny unit. - Details on request. Will submit on request.
,,U. Vellanikaran,Well worth the price,17 May 2009,5.0 ,This is a very good portable speaker for the ipod. I use it to listen at soft volumes to music in bed and when traveling. The sound quality is remarkably good for the size. I think it has a very balanced output above about 120 hz or so. Open and and clear in the midranges and above. Very little bass but at low levels with acoustic and other small ensemble music it is a pleasing speaker. Generally good construction and aesthetics.
,,Robert De Chaineau,great little speaker,24 Feb 2013,5.0 ,I take the dog out and I love to run my mp3 through these speaker( not a big fan of head phones). The sound is very good.
,,Brian Friske,"Good sound, eats up batteries quick",02 Jan 2013,3.0 ,"Sounds good, but we needed ours for a white noise machine attached off of an iPad. Therefore the batteries were dead after two nights of use. Ended up getting the GOgroove SonaWAVE which can be plugged into the wall & sounds just as good if not better. This one is a tad smaller for portability."
,,Unique Lady,Great speaker,10 Mar 2011,5.0 ,"Ok I just plugged this into my lap top and the sound is AWESOME, I was totally blown away with the quality of the sound and the size. SUch a big sound coming from something so small. I was kind of skeptical at first but I am so glad I made this purchase."
,,Anthony,Whoever rated this under 5 stars is crazy and most likely meant to rate the company NOT THE PRODUCT.,27 Apr 2012,5.0 ,"This speaker is 22 dollars people and works twice as good as any portable speaker I have had. If it is up too loud the quality might be down, but for a portable speaker to use doing laundry, in the bathroom, or in the car along with other uses for portable things, it is a great speaker. GREAT PRODUCT. BUY IT NOW! FROM AMAZON! :)"
,,hudrock,Great sound for a great price,11 Apr 2011,5.0 ,"This speaker has very good sound for the size and price,, haven't had it long enough to rate the durability or battery life but this is just what I was looking for to take camping/backpacking. Totally recommend it."
,,Atomic Goats Breath,Five Stars,08 Jan 2015,5.0 ,great sound out of a very small package
,,Talon,"Works good, but bc the power button doesn't work I ...",24 Oct 2015,2.0 ,"Works good , but bc the power button doesn't work I have to take put batteries when not using."
,,Simply Tuned,big sound little price,31 Aug 2010,5.0 ,"very impressed with the size ,sound and quality, most importantly the price!, what a great bargain for the sound quality!!!"
,,Amazon Customer,Big sound in a small package,11 Jan 2014,4.0 ,Although not the sound of a big high quality speaker - this speaker enhanced my laptop mike and is great for travelers who make presentations.
,,JB,"OK, but not any better than cheaper ones I've heard.",26 Jul 2013,3.0 ,"A big improvement over the laptop speakers. However, distortion with bass comes up at a lower volume than you'd expect., and as other reviewers stated, the cord is much too short."
,,laura,LMTucson,19 Oct 2011,5.0 ,"We purchased this gadget at the advice of a friend who had recently bought one and we are very pleased with the purchase. The quality of the sound is pretty amazing, given the size of the device. Volume is just right - good for personal/outdoor use but not enough to fill a backyard. And the price is right."
,,K.C.,AL iM227 MP3 Speaker,04 Feb 2012,4.0 ,"Did everything I expected it would. From my desk to car, I can play my mp3. The speaker fits nicely into my pocket. Only downside is the sound is a bit tinny, not a lot of bass but for the price it works great."
,,vernon e. miles jr.,Awesome,22 Jun 2015,4.0 ,"Great sound , only there is no volume on it, so you have to use devices volume control. Other than that it's great and it came with batteries."
,,Brian J. Rueger,Very Good Product,12 Jun 2010,5.0 ,I was surprised at the quality of this item. Great sound. I use it with my Motorola Droid to listen to audio books.
,,Kathy Detweiler,Like it!,17 Nov 2010,4.0 ,I wanted a small speaker to hook up to my Phillips Go Gear MP3 player. This little gadget fits the bill. It isn't super loud but it does let me listen to my music while I'm house cleaning or relaxing outside. I only wish it had an ac adapter. I think it would be perfect for an office.
,,Nancy E.,Small Speaker Huge Sound,18 Dec 2013,5.0 ,"A friend recommended this small speaker for traveling and to watch videos on the ipad with a bit more sound than ear plugs. I love it and the batteries last so long, it always amazes me. The sound quality is good and the music sounds great."
,,Miss Shegas,Nice for price but go bigger if you can,07 Nov 2014,4.0 ,"Is good but can distort when turned all the way up. Batteries are good for about a week depending on use. Keep a supply. Good for money but if you can afford more, keep looking."
,,Catherine Coughlin,Good for the price and portability ...,29 Mar 2013,4.0 ,"Good for the price and portability, but it can only handle the sound being up so high -- otherwise, the sound becomes scratchy ... at the time, it suited my purposes and was a great little speaker for traveling ..."
,,dsisco,i got this to listen to music on my smart phone and it works great i listen to hard ...,08 Nov 2014,5.0 ,i got this to listen to music on my smart phone and it works great i listen to hard core and it sounds great ! most speakers are designed for rap and crap like that so im verry happy with it .also the batteries last around 4 hours
,,David Back,Happy With Purchase Even After 1.5 Years,14 Dec 2013,4.0 ,"This little speaker does indeed put out a surprising amount of sound. You won't have to struggle to hear it, even when outdoors. It could use a little more bass, but that is a given with just about any speaker of this size."
,,KE Hoffman,Excellent portable and lightweight speaker,20 Nov 2011,4.0 ,"This little gadget is great if you want a portable, lightweight speaker for travel. Two downsides: the cable connecting to your PC is very short meaning if you're sitting at your computer the sound is too close. Also, at its max volume the sound becomes unstable. Still, it's become a permanent feature in my travel bag and the bass boost is just right."
,,John G. Bennett,"light, clear, cord too short",14 Nov 2011,4.0 ,"I first saw something like this in China, heavier but amazing sound. Don't know who made that one. This one is quite light, which I guess is a plus, and has good clear sound with reasonable bass. I bought it for use with an MP3 player, but it also turns out to be much better than my laptop speakers. The only downside is the cable is too short to reach around my computer. Another 6"" even would have been useful. Note for those who have trouble winding the cord: the plastic holder attaches two positions. If you can't put the cable into the holder, then take the holder off, turn it halfway, click it into the new place and try again. Overall nice, not mindblowing, but great value for the price."
,,"From Austin, Texas",A good speaker,20 Nov 2014,5.0 ,Amazing battery life and clean clear sound that can get respectably loud. I'd recommend it no question. 3.5 TRS male plug wraps around a track on the bottom and tucks away.
,,KyTom,Wife loves her Orbit,20 Aug 2013,5.0 ,"Good sound for the size. She takes it everywhere and especially on camping trips. As the saying goes, "" When mama's happy, everyone is happy."" Thumbs up recommended. Note! Turn it off when not in use."
,,William J Murray,I've never been disappointed by an Altec Lansing speaker,05 Mar 2015,5.0 ,"I've never been disappointed by an Altec Lansing speaker! High quality, great volume for its size, and unusually good tone balance for such a small speaker. This is the third one I've purchased. They make excellent gifts."
,,H. Hollmann,Good response to call about a problem,16 Jan 2012,5.0 ,The product is fine. It was for a gift. The problem I had was that the package was received in good condition on the outside but IT HAD BEEN REPACKAGED and the package was torn and messed up but I spoke to a representative and she said if it didn't work I could return it. So I decided to give the gift and the recipient said it worked fine.
,,LH,Five Stars,19 Oct 2015,5.0 ,Very nice product. Thanks.
,,Randall Klingerman,Good sound. I bought this before they came out ...,24 Apr 2015,5.0 ,Good sound. I bought this before they came out with all the blue tooth speakers. The batteries are expensive to replace. Buy a blue tooth.
,,Flea Diva,Great Little Speaker!,05 Jul 2011,5.0 ,"I bought this because my friend had it and I was so impressed by the sound quality. Got mine and it's great. No complaints here, and you can't beat the price."
,,John D-H,Lasted 6 months then died,31 Oct 2012,1.0 ,"Bought it the end of May, it stopped working the end of October. Worked OK when it worked. The design is kind of weird in that the connection wire is on the side away from the on/off switch and light resulting in several ""forgot to turn off so the batteries were used up"" events."
,,Roberto Roberts,Did nothing to improve the sound of my HP Notebook.,30 May 2013,1.0 ,"In fact my Notebook speakers are superior, with a few built-in tweaks. While this item did offer higher volume, the bass distortion is an unacceptable trade-off. The manual does not explain how to load the batteries. A call to the manufacturer was no help at all. Don't waste your money."
,,Sea Ray,Amazing Sound For Such a Small Box,12 Jan 2012,5.0 ,This little box puts out amazing sound. My family was watching a TV show on the laptop in another room and I thought we had houseguests! I walked into the room only to see that my daughter had hooked up her Altec speaker. We mainly use it for playing music from the iPod and it's equally clear and impressive
,,Thomas S,Good all purpose speaker,03 Mar 2010,4.0 ,"I purchased the iM237 to play voice files on my laptop computer. For this purpose, the small speaker preforms well and can even serve for IPOD play back in a pinch. Overall, sound is lacking in bass and it will distort at high volumes. However, its small size makes it a good companion for mobile use. Recommended."
,,Jerseyjoe68,iM-237 Orbit Speaker,18 Apr 2011,5.0 ,Purchased this as a portable speaker for my iPhone. Sound is great for the size and meets all my expectations. I selected this speaker based on other reviews and am happy about the purchase. Great sound for the price and perfect for on the go. Can't expect more out of a small battery powered speaker. Only con is that it is not rechargable.
,,Troy Kellogg,Great little speaker,16 Jun 2009,5.0 ,"This device is plenty loud for moderately quiet environments, its no boombox so dont expect it to drown out loud noises, but its louder than I thought it would be. The only negative I can think of is its size, its not large, but it doesnt fit in a pocket, cant have it all"
,,Tom Lane,have a volume knob to control the sound but when you use it it comes out super loud and almost annoyingly loud with no way to ..,02 Sep 2014,2.0 ,"I thought that this speaker would, at least, have a volume knob to control the sound but when you use it it comes out super loud and almost annoyingly loud with no way to control it."
,,Nimajneb,Good things come in small packages,17 Dec 2009,5.0 ,"For the size of the unit and the price, these are awesome speakers. Great sound, easy to use, aesthetically pleasing."
,,Tammy H,Love it,14 Feb 2014,5.0 ,Love it; does exactly what I wanted it to do. Very good quality. Just like the ones I see on tv.
,,Amazon Customer,The best portable speaker by a country mile,11 Apr 2011,5.0 ,"I have now bought 2 of these speakers and I cannot speak highly enough of the sound & build quality. I also own the original Orbit speaker, and this newer version raises the bar on an already excellent product. If you are in the market for a portable speaker, buy this one without hesitation."
,,P.M.,The mighty little speaker,24 Jan 2009,5.0 ,"Bought this for my wife to use at work and it has incredible sound for such a tiny speaker. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a small easy to carry around speaker. Wife was concerned that it was not stereo, but after testing it out, she is very happy with it."
,,Jim Kill,Great sound for a small package and price,09 Jan 2012,4.0 ,"Yes, you can do better by paying 3 times the price, but for the small price, this speaker more than exceeds expectations. Decent build quality- it's been dropped and dangled quite a bit and still works. The only negative is the battery- it requires 3 AAA and we get about 16 hours from a set - so be sure to have your rechargeables ready"
,,Krista M. Leopold,It works for me,27 Sep 2011,4.0 ,"We got one from a friend and promptly lost it. It was worth replacing -- it's sound quality is just right for a little speaker in little places. Not as effective outside or in large areas, but perfect for the bedroom or the back porch. Love that it is so portable!"
,,mark swatzell,I am so impressed!,27 Dec 2008,5.0 ,"I love portable powered speakers for some reason and have purchased quite a few over the years. I picked this one up before a recent trip, and attached to my Zune it filled the condo with clear perfect sound. The three AAA batteries lasted the whole week with no sign of dying off. I was stunned at the quality for the size and can't believe how much better portable speakers have gotten. I'll take it on every trip!"
,,B. Taylor,Great Bicycle Speaker,21 Aug 2009,5.0 ,"I bought this speaker cause I like to play music on long bicycle rides. This speaker is perfectly lightweight with more than enough volume, very durable, and the best part is it fits in my water botttle holder!!! I just use a little bunge to make sure it's not going anywhere and although the line to my MP3 player is short, it works just fine with my player in my handlebar bag. AWESOME!!!!"
,,bargin hunter,good speaker with low price,29 Oct 2011,5.0 ,"This item has very good sound quality, even better than the much expensive, fancy ones from Lifetrons. I went back to Amazon to buy another one."
,,Erin R.,Great little product,11 Dec 2012,5.0 ,"I bought this speaker to take on vacation with my iPod and I love it! It offers big sound in a small package. Since there isn't a volume control, you just have to use the iPod controls - being old school this threw me off at first. :)"
,,Connie Kalberg,Perfect portable speaker,27 Apr 2010,5.0 ,"This speaker is perfect for portability and sound. I just have a shuffle, and it met my need perfectly. I bought it primarily for on the golf cart, but now use it in lots of rooms in the house when I want my favorite songs. Good sound, good price and I received it only three days after I placed the order. Several golfing friends will be getting one. I am very happy with the purchase."
,,sardog10,Great Little Speaker!,16 Nov 2011,5.0 ,"I just received this today and can't say I know a lot about the technical aspect of speakers, but I can tell you that when I plugged it into the music on my phone and turned it on for the first time I was shocked at how great the sound quality was. I was expecting it to be okay but not much more than that, given the price (I paid just over $13), but I am thrilled with this purchase. When I travel I like to have my music playing in the hotel room and this far surpasses my laptop speakers and is about 1/3 the size of the portable speaker I've taken with me thus far. I notice the price has gone up to $22 today but I'll be watching for it to drop again and then will definitely be purchasing another one for my son."
,,John N. Okazaki,like the battery capability vs,23 Aug 2014,3.0 ,"Volume a little low, like the battery capability vs. rechargeable."
,,Kelly H,compact & great sound,20 Jan 2013,5.0 ,"Just what I was looking for for use at the office. Compact, easily portable and great sound. Love that I can tuck it away in the drawer when needed. Perfect for the price :-)"
,,Kindle Customer,Not worth the money!,14 Sep 2009,1.0 ,This speaker played great for a few weeks and then started to pop like popcorn. The on and off switch also has problems with not staying where you put it on or off. The real bad news is it is so cheap it is better to trash it than pay the post to return it.
,,paderm,Great speakers!!,10 Mar 2013,5.0 ,I use this once to twice a week (2-3 hours each) for the past 6 months. I still have the first pair of AAA batteries in the speaker I put in there when I bought it. It has a great loud sound that picks up where my laptop leaves off. Highly recommend for the low price.
,,Mr Peetles,Amazing sound and price,09 Oct 2011,5.0 ,I was completely surprised by the sound quality and bass response from such a tiny speaker and such a tiny price. I don't understand how they can see this so cheaply. Great buy.
,,S. G. Damitz,Handy Dandy little speaker,30 Jun 2011,3.0 ,"I purchased this to use in my office with my little mp3 player. It has pretty good sound but don't expect rich sound. That being said, this little speaker really saved my bacon. At a professional conference , a lap top more or less malfunctioned and no one could hear the sound of the video. I pulled this little baby out of my case and plugged it in the lap top, voila. Nice loud sound , easy for everyone in the room to hear ( about 30 people in room about 25X30). I was very impressed. At break time, I then plugged the speaker in to my mp3 player and everyone enjoyed the music . It is well worth the money."
,,jtimberman,Decent small speaker,13 May 2013,3.0 ,"This is a good small speaker. The sound output is much better than the iPad mini it's usually connected to. The only negative is that the battery cover is a little ""fiddly"" and causes the batteries to not make great contact."
,,dbhclt,Performs as advertised; not a room-filler,16 Jan 2013,4.0 ,"Altec im227 Orbit mp3 speaker performs as advertised. It delivers very good sound to a limited area. Beyond 8 feet, it is not what you need."
,,Despina Eleftheriou,Big sound small speaker,10 Aug 2011,4.0 ,This is a very small speaker. It fits anywhere and it makes great sound. The only downside is the bass isn't great
,,LoveToRead,Wonderful speaker,25 Jun 2011,5.0 ,"I was surprised at how loud this speaker can get. Great sound for something so small. I bought this for a children's Bible class to play music, and it will be more than adequate in the size room we use. Bought to use with the Sansa SanDisk player."
,,AJ,Good Value,11 Sep 2009,5.0 ,"I, like others, was pleasantly surprised at the quality from such a small product. I use this in my garage to listen to my I-Pod while working. It's not going to blow away any of you audio-philes; but if you're looking for something compact and portable to provide ambient levels of music from your favorite audio player, I highly recommenced this product."
,,Anne on a Mouse,Great speaker!,24 Nov 2013,5.0 ,"This is my favorite portable speaker! Great for podcasts and music on the go. It has no volume control (volume has to be controlled via playing device), which is the only drawback. Otherwise it offers fantastic sound quality, solid battery life (takes three AAAs), and good volume."
,,Marcos,Awesome sound!!,05 Dec 2010,5.0 ,"I'm very happy with this little, but powerful speaker! =) I know and listen to many other little speakers, for this kind of price, many were garbage, and others with some little more quality (than cheaper speakers) are expensive and not portable as this one. Watch out for the loud bass! For watching movies from your lap or pico projector, buy 2! =)"
,,asiahs,WIRE SHORTS OUT AFTER LESS THAN A YEAR,05 Feb 2014,2.0 ,"It's a decent speaker....but after less than a year, the wire shorted. It has gotten progressively worse over the past 1+ year. Now it's barely functional. DON'T BUY. Unless the speaker stays in a single place and isnt used portably."
,,N Rabbitt,fantastic little speaker,02 Jan 2013,4.0 ,Everyone who has seen/heard mine has wanted one of their own. Just wish it had its own volume control independent of device its plugged into. You will not be disappointed with its sound. Runs on 3 AAA and drains them a bit faster than I like. I still think its a great speaker
,,Lurkeycharms,Awesome speaker!,12 May 2011,5.0 ,"I only had this speaker for a month, but so far, so great! I use it for my iPod when I clean up on Sundays. Very loud and the sound is clear. I keep reading other reviews saying that it breaks after a while. Well...we'll see. In the meantime, it's pretty awesome."
,,Rog the Elder,Great little speaker,05 Mar 2011,5.0 ,"I have an Altec Lansing speaker system on my computer which is phenomenal, so I did not think it would be a stretch to think that this wouldn't be as good. I hooked it to my ipod touch and it was great. Just what I expected. It was loud enough to hear in a noisy backroom at my work, sure it won't fill a concert hall, but it fits in your pocket. Love it! 5 stars!"
,,lou,Impressed,23 Apr 2011,5.0 ,"Was just looking for a little speaker to take on a cruise. Price about $20 bucks thought what the heck it will at least be better than nothing. Hooked up to my mp3 and man was I impressed. The sound quality blew me away, even at max volume. Saw the same speaker online at best buy for $39 bucks. Definitely a good buy....."
,,Bfaithful,"One of my ""favorite things""",17 Mar 2009,5.0 ,I am so pleased with the sound quality of this portable speaker. What a difference now using this speaker plugged into my laptop as I watch movies. The dialogue in so much clearer to understand (especially in older or foreign movies). My sister also ordered one and she uses it with her MP3 player daily. Another advantage is being able to use triple A batteries which can be purchased anywhere.
,,242rox,Very nice product for the money...,15 Dec 2010,5.0 ,"I bought this to use with my iPad. The sound that I get is remarkable. It is better than any other portable speaker that I have used in the past. I am very pleased with the sound quality, the portability and the ease of use. I also like the small case that it came with. All in all, for me, it is a very good product that I would have no problem recommending. Very pleased."
,,teknician,you will be amazed at the sound they pack into this thing,26 Sep 2014,5.0 ,the sound on this speaker is truly exceptional -- and LOUD! you will be amazed at the sound they pack into this thing.
,,j.chan,music for your ears,14 Feb 2014,3.0 ,Good speaker. But you need to be very careful with the cord .in time if used a lot the cord will start to separate from the jack ...
,,Marg,Music Lover,28 Feb 2013,5.0 ,Love listening to all my music. Will probably purchase another for my sister. She thought it was the neatest thing.
,,Jersey Boy,CAN IT BE ANY BETTER THAN THIS?,02 Jun 2011,5.0 ,"This is a superb speaker, and everyone who hears it when I use it agree. I think you would need to spend a lot of money to get something better. Altec-Lansing at the top of its game as usual."
,,Globe99,"Small package, big sound",16 Oct 2010,5.0 ,"Works very well, I use this in my kitchen to play music or other audio from my iPhone while cooking/eating/cleaning. For such a small speaker (about the size of a large-ish muffin), very decent quality sound that fills the room. There's a carrying case included, so you could potentially take it on the road (but I haven't tried). In general, I'm happy with my purchase."
,,Camdawg,Nifty lil speaker,04 Jan 2012,4.0 ,"It's got rich sound for its size, but it's definitely not a loud speaker as it quickly distorts out when the volume turns up. I would buy this again if I had to, but I don't have to, so I guess I won't, yet."
,,yogamom,Great sound from a little speaker...,16 Jan 2013,4.0 ,"This speaker may be small, but the sound it produces isn't. It is very compact and travels easily. I use it with my android smart phone all the time and it generates very clear sound for its size."
,,Sarah Smith,Value for money,03 Jan 2012,5.0 ,"Great little speaker. I bought it as a present for my husband and he is very critical of sound quality. The tone is quite warm and not tinny or trebly at all. The speaker is compact and packs down easily. I can't comment on how quickly it goes through batteries. I only hope that they last a while. If they do, it will be a perfect little travel speaker."
,,TX Reader,Love It!,22 Nov 2013,5.0 ,Bought this speaker to use with my iPod when we go on vacation. The video does not lie! It sounds really great for its size!
,,Ki-hon Lin,"Inexpensive, portable, and SOUNDS GREAT!",03 Feb 2010,5.0 ,"Just got this little speaker and plugged it into my Droid. It is small, portable, relatively inexpensive, and sounds incredibly good for such a small little item - rich, full sound (don't get me wrong, it doesn't have huge bass sound or twinkling highs, but still) that is quite surprising. Highly recommended"
,,Thomas McWain,Cool!,17 Mar 2014,5.0 ,Cool speaker! I used to use this in the shower until I broke up with my girlfriend and she smashed it in the bathroom. I've since had to use a different speaker and obain a different girlfriend.
,,Olywajpa,Wow!,25 Dec 2009,5.0 ,"I bought this for my husband for xmas. I was a little nervous that this little speaker could play with any quality. I was WRONG. We tested Pearl Jam to Elvis to Black Eyed Peas ""Boom Boom"" song and I was blown away. Who knew that such a small speaker could put out Bass??? Not tinny, Not whimpy. Will be awesome to camp/hike/golf with. Great little speaker."
,,Chickadee,Small but great sound!,19 Jan 2014,4.0 ,I was surprised at how good the sound was from such a small speaker. Works great with my MP3 player.
,,farsidechat,BOOMING SOUND FROM TINY SPEAKER!,18 Jan 2012,5.0 ,THIS LITTLE SPEAKER AMAZED ME WITH ITS DEEP BASS AND FANTASTIC SOUND REPRODUCTION. I HOOKED IT TO MY TINY MP3 PLAYER AND WAS ASTONISHED BY THE RICHNESS OF THE SOUND. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE. AND THE PRICE IS GREAT TOO!
,,CZ,Great for price!,26 Oct 2011,4.0 ,"Very nice speaker for the price! We use these outdoors for sound effects, and they work great! Don't bother with the higher priced model, as there is no difference except the other one comes with a soft case."
,,Pyle,Awesome,13 Sep 2013,5.0 ,"I love this thing! I used it at work in a busy restaurant kitchen and could hear it perfectly amongst clanking, banging, yelling and frying! The amazing sound that comes out of this little tiny thing is impressive. Impressive battery life as well."
,,Sarah Thompson,Sound quality is AWFUL!,21 Dec 2009,1.0 ,"I bought this to use with my iPod while traveling. When it came, I tested it out at home. The sound was so incredibly awful that I didn't even make it through one song. It sounded like the pocket transistor radio I had in the early 60's! In addition, the on/off switch takes just a bump (as in a suitcase) to get turned on, which could result in used up batteries. And no amount of wrestling with it would get it into its extremely tight-fitting case. I have a larger portable Altec-Lansing stereo speaker for my iPod at home and I love it. This is WAY below their usual high standards."
,,Allen Howard,Not a bad little speaker,27 Nov 2010,4.0 ,"Don't expect everybody at a party to be able to hear it. It doesn't really have the volume that is implied, but it's not bad at all for a battery-driven amplifier."
,,sean1193,worth the price,07 Aug 2011,4.0 ,Took this speaker on a camping trip and was surprised at how good it sounded. It doesn't get extremely loud but it's good enough for a campsite. It's hard to judge how long the battery lasted because we had it on quite a bit and it lasted a little over one day. It's worth the money for sure.
,,R. FRANCE,Outstanding performance,20 Sep 2010,5.0 ,"I purchased this product expecting far less in performance than was delivered. This single speaker is amazing and produces clear and powerful sound when following Altec's recommendiation regarding setting volume level to around 80%. As satisified as I am with this product, I'm hoping Altec develops a two speaker system using this iM-237."
,,Thomas A. Oehser,The best for this size.,06 Nov 2013,5.0 ,"This is my second one of these, the first I gave to my wife. The other one was silver and came with a zipper pouch, otherwise exactly the same. Great sound for the size, I haven't found any other product comparable."
,,sribble,Altec Lansing speaker,21 Sep 2013,5.0 ,"This is the best small speakers have ever come across. I use it with my iPhone, iPad, and Microsoft computer to enhance the quality and volume of whatever I am listening to from audio books to on-line continuing Ed to music."
,,MsPav,screetchfest,08 Sep 2012,1.0 ,"Worked ok for a while - at the 80% volume required by the company, it is not loud enough (and I am a ""mature adult"" not a teen, I didn't require it to play really loud). But after a month or so it started to screech and won't stop. It is now totally useless."
,,Austin Shellito,Best speaker for vacation,30 Jan 2013,5.0 ,"We got this speaker for a vacation and it worked like a champ, we used it next to the pool, on the beach and became the party location as we were the only ones with music.. I have also bought another just for a gift so our friends would have the same experience."
,,mr.cee,big sound small speaker,01 Apr 2012,5.0 ,"I'M USALLY SKEPTICAL, ABOUT BUYING ON LINE,BUT THIS PRODUCT TOOK ME BY SURPIRSE.THE SOUND THAT CAME OUT THIS SMALL SPEAKER SOUNDS LIKE IT'S A BIG SPEAKER.I CONNECT THIS SPEAKER TO MY TRANSITTER RADIO,AND IT SOUNDS LIKE A BOOM BOX. MY IPOD UNBELIEVEABLE. I WOULD DEFINELY RECOMEND THIS TO A FRIEND OR FAMILY. AND ITS VERY AFFORDABLE. LOVE IT"
,,LeoB,One word - WOW!,11 Oct 2011,5.0 ,"Absolutely amazed by the sound of this little speaker, and the price! Added bonus, my cell has an FM radio (not online radio) that needs a headset cord to act as an antenna. This speaker cord works fine, so I can listen to FM in addition to music, podcasts, and audiobooks. What a find."
,,Boingofan23,best portable speaker ever,29 Jul 2012,5.0 ,"After purchasing a couple of ok portable speakers over the years, finally I found the end all, be all of speakers. This speaker not only sounds terrific, but it also gets nice and loud, in fact, this speaker is louder and sounds better than the altec lansings built-in to my laptop. I definitely would recommend these to anyone."
,,DJR,Good Stuff! I like it.-Updated,15 Nov 2011,2.0 ,"I bought two of these for myself and wife. We've had ours for about two weeks. No problems and sounds good. 3-AAA batteries required, not included. The package has a dotted line indicating where you should cut to open the package properly. Follow the lines or you'll end up wrestling with the package. (like my wife) There is a wristband that is in the package, it can be easily overlooked and thrown away. (like my wife) :) I payed $12.50 each with free shipping. I like them so much I was going to buy a couple for Christmas gifts. Price now $22. Oh well!! If you see it cheaper, comment on my interview, I'll get a notification. Thanks!! One last thing. The instructions say to not play the your music higher than 75% -80% of maximum. I suspect that may cause the speaker to blow. (wife's is still ok, but I had to remind her) :) IMPORTANT UPDATE: I bought two of these speakers, they didn't last. If you are looking for something long term, I recommend you get something else. After about 3-4 months, they started ""screeching"". Loud squealing noises when trying to play music."
,,zatarra,great battery life and better sound than im207,11 Jun 2011,5.0 ,This speaker is great for work. I've had mine for a year now and it's still going strong. The soft cover case with lanyard works great. I have mine attached to my lunch box. This is got to be the best product when you want music but can't use headphones. Uses AAA (I use rechargable) batteries. Very good value all around. Highly Recommended.
,,chubbobubs,Altec Lansing iM227 Orbit MP3 Speaker,16 Mar 2012,4.0 ,"Pretty good bang for your buck. Now I can take my music anywhere-- the speaker is uber portable, and produces higher quality sound than I expected. Only downside that I can see so far is that it no longer comes with a protective carrying case."
,,Zachary J. Bytsura,Good little speaker.,06 Jan 2013,4.0 ,Has about the same volume as my droid but much better quality. Not great for work like I hoped but still useful.
,,Greens31,Product is very poor,05 Jun 2013,1.0 ,"received product on time and seemed to work fine over first few months. Now the speaker squeaks loudly and will only play at a very low volume. I cannot recommend this item at all, beware before you purchase. I've basically quit using it."
,,B. Holbert,What a BOOMING!!! little Speaker.,13 Oct 2011,5.0 ,"This is the best portable speaker I've purchase. It is compact, loud and with bass that I wasn't exspecting. I am very pleased with product and will purchase another. I let my friends and family hear the sound of this speaker. This will be a gift to buy for chritmas for my love ones."
,,"Nancy in Minneapolis, MN",One Star,03 Mar 2015,1.0 ,did not last long
,,Luke,Awesome sound quality!!!,11 Dec 2011,5.0 ,More sound than I could have ever imagined out of this product. After reading a few reviews I decided to purchase this product and I'm glad I did. I will let you know how the battery life is after a few uses but for now I'm impressed with the quality and the volume that this speaker produces.
,,Goathead,Awesome Little Speaker!,20 Nov 2012,5.0 ,"Very good sound quality for such a little speaker. I use it for my desktop, laptop, iPad, iPod, and iPhone. I've got desktop speakers and a USB speaker that both sound better, but you can't beat this for portability and versatility."
,,Pat,Wonderful sound!,23 Feb 2013,5.0 ,We have a winner! This provides a great sound for a great price! The volume & quality of sound are perfect for at-home or at-work use. I can finally stop looking!
,,Robert B.,cool product,20 Jun 2010,4.0 ,I like it. It could be louder but it could be the iPhone's fault not the speaker.
,,Chuck Yeager,Excellent little speaker!,12 May 2011,5.0 ,"This Altec Lansing speaker is perfect for portable use. I've only tested it out with my laptop so far, but the sound quality is far above my expectations for the size and price. I plan on using this for summer vacations and camping trips where we can use the laptop and portable music players to be able to enjoy our tunes."
,,Frank Parrilli,Portable great sound,02 Oct 2009,5.0 ,"GREAT SPEAKER..... I love the Altec speaker I purchased for my i pod. It is small compact and delivers enough sound to fill a room. Doubles the use of my i pod from gym companion to room filling sound machine......comes with case, portable and a lot of fun....really pleased."
,,Billy H. Riddle,Better than Advertised!,25 Dec 2009,5.0 ,This product was better than advertised. I got it instead of a whole jam system. Now I can play my Ipod without having my earphones on all the time with GOOD QUALITY SOUND!
,,B Davids,Great speaker!,30 Oct 2011,5.0 ,"I used this speaker while on a field assignment, stuck on a John Deere Gator for a week in the middle of nowhere. The battery lasted at least a good 40 hours, and the sound was great! I would recommend this to anyone looking for an inexpensive portable speaker."
,,Walter Marlin,Mittens $,12 Apr 2014,3.0 ,The sound is a bit hard... muff it a bit. It is a hardy little thing although. Put it inside a mitten.
,,Jessica,great!,28 Nov 2011,5.0 ,"For the price this is a great, powerful little speaker. We used it while travelling and it was great! It's great for smaller spaces and does not require an outlet."
,,Purple Rose,"If it stops working, read this . . .",02 Jun 2010,4.0 ,"I bought this little speaker about a year ago. It was good to have while traveling. It's very light and comes with a little case, so it is easy to pack. I even listen to it at home in rooms that don't have a music source. However, about a month ago I tried to use it and it screeched and sputtered. So I put in new batteries. It didn't work at all! I had noticed when I put in the batteries that there was some white stuff in the battery compartment and that one of the metal terminals was discolored. I read on the internet that you could wipe off the corrosion with a little Isopropyl Alcohol on a lint-free cloth. I tried it and let the speaker air dry. Then I put the fresh batteries that I had bought into the speaker and it worked like new! So, to summarize: this is a good little speaker for the price. Don't turn your iPOD on too loud, or it will sound terrible. But at low to about 75% percent volume it sounds as good as the mid-priced Jam Box I used to have when I was a teenager. The little battery cover is VERY annoying. It comes off easily, but doesn't go back on very easily at all."
,,VIJAY DHARIA,Good Portable Speaker,27 Jul 2010,5.0 ,I love this portable speaker from ALTEC. It would be the best and perfect speaker if it was possible to run on both the batteries and AC.
,,Force1715,Good sound for small unit.,15 Feb 2014,5.0 ,Its small but it gives good sound. Not to much bass but what would you expect in a unit that is this portable. I take it with me on trips cause it doesnt take up much space!
,,snr6253,Great Speaker for the price,03 Feb 2012,5.0 ,"I didn't really expect this speaker to be so powerful. It is very compact, but sounds great. Don't turn it up to the max, however, because the sound will be distorted. But that's just common sense."
,,H.M.A.,does what it suppsed to well!,18 Apr 2010,5.0 ,ya this thing is great! I take it on all travels and listen to my techy podcasts with my android phone. Really happy with this. Three small batteries will last quite a while. Cool travel bag too that i can attached to my backpack via the clip-on that comes with it. I plan to use it this summer on vacation for music by the pool too :-)
,,Robbie,exactly what i needed.,02 Jan 2012,5.0 ,Wanted a portable speaker to hook up to iPod and phone. This is awesome!! As loud as you will ever need it to be. Sound quality is exquisite. I also bought some AAA batteries off Amazon so I will always have some hand.. but j have used this for hours and the battery is still going strong. Buy this..
,,Nancie,Altec Lansing portable speaker,01 Dec 2010,5.0 ,Great little speaker. Friend who travels with musician had it and after I heard how good it sounded when online and ordered it right away. Could not beat the price. Arrived on time.

,,Kerphline S.,I hate USPS,18 Feb 2013,2.0 ,The product itself is not bad it's pretty loud the sound quality is o.k it's not sharp but it does what it needs tobut it took me forever to recieve it due to usps. The product is good however the batteries are the most annoying thing about it.
,,Handyman,This is my second one. Its great!,08 Sep 2010,5.0 ,So good that i am buying for the second time. This should tell you something about the quality. Its great!
,,John C. Fryer III,"Nice sound, great value",06 Apr 2014,4.0 ,"Nice sound, great value. Much better than most of the cheap, tinny speakers. If you want an inexpensive, portable speaker, I don't think you can find a better sounding one for the price. I have two now."
,,BAKERBOY81,wow!!!!!,19 Nov 2010,5.0 ,"the first time that i plugged in the speaker,it was amazing.... i never thought that a little speaker could but out so much sound. it uses three AAA batteries. i have used it for about 26 hours and it still going. this is one of the best buys that i have made this year by far... you all should get one. it wont let you down trust me...."
,,Francisco Castillo,Excelente producto,12 Apr 2010,5.0 ,"Me acompaña en todo viaje, para un ambiente musical en tan compacto tamaño vale la pena, sobre todo para andar en morral o bolso pequeño...sonido antec , en cuartos cerrados de hotel muy buen sonido, exterior como playa para ambientar,"
,,Book worm,A great little item for the price !,03 May 2009,4.0 ,"I am very happy with the speaker. I take it in my car and anyplace else I want it. It's easy to use and the sound is very reasonable for the price. The small size makes it even easier to take. I am happy I bought it. I do wish it had an adaptor, however."
,,Ernest Gonzales,One good little speaker...,30 Mar 2010,5.0 ,"This is one good little speaker. I use it on a daily basis with the job I have. It has never given me any problems. Sure it's mono, but what did ya expect for how much it is?.... I'm glad I listened to a friend of mine and purchased one. He's got the first version of this speaker and it's ok, but this one is a lot better than their first version...Good job Altec!!!!"
,,Drew,Great Speaker,08 Jul 2011,5.0 ,Bought this for my wife and she uses i with her phone. She wanted it after seeing my brother in law with his and she loves it. Sound is surprisingly good for a little speaker. Batteries last a good while as well. I'd definitely recommend it.
,,lllee50,Altex Lansing Orbit Speaker,09 Feb 2014,4.0 ,"This helps the sound tremendously, but the cord to plug in to your device is way to short. You need to keep the speaker within inches of your device, which sometimes is impossible."
,,S,Not what I expected,24 Feb 2014,2.0 ,"This is good if you want a mobile speaker. I was expecting something that plugged into an electrical outlet, rather than running on batteries. The batteries ran out in less than 1 week (of very little use) and a piercing alarm sounded."
,,Chad Kuehn,Three Stars,06 Nov 2015,3.0 ,Sound is good but replacing batteries suck. I would rather have an electrical connection that charged the battery.
,,Ryan Mease,"Sounds great, I like how I can use it as ...",25 Sep 2014,5.0 ,"Sounds great, I like how I can use it as a portable speaker with many applications: Laptop, iPad, and iPhone!"
,,G. Angeles,Great little portable speaker for the IPHONE.,01 Jan 2010,5.0 ,Bought this for my girlfriend. The sound is pretty good for a portable speaker. Love the fact that it has a protective case/pouch. Perfect for the IPHONE. The only thing I don't like is that the compartment that holds the battery is hard to close. But despite that I think I'll buy one for myself.
,,Chad Morin,Great Item. Just a little pricy.,08 Mar 2014,5.0 ,"This would be better if it had a volume control on it, battery life seems good. Not extremely deep sound but good for the size and price."
,,Penguin,The little speaker with big sound,28 Feb 2011,5.0 ,One of the best purchases I've ever made. This little speaker lives up to Altec Lansing's big sound. I can take it anywhere and connect it to anything with a headphone/speaker jack! The battery life is better than expected. I get a lot of use out of it and have never had a problem with it (nearly 2 years old).
,,Larry S.,Great Product,19 Jan 2014,5.0 ,"For it's size and price it's great. Really sounds more powerful than it's size would indicate. It has clear, sharp sound. I bought it for a present for my wife and she loves it and uses it often."
,,charles m,"Little Speaker, Big Sound",01 Aug 2011,5.0 ,"I purchased this speaker, because of the reviews on AOL. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the sound. I've raved it to my friends it every since it came, and after listening to it, they bought one too! You can't go wrong with it. It's rare these days to find a product that's better than it's reviews."
,,rene lafontaine,broke,25 Nov 2012,1.0 ,this product work very well until labout five weeks in and then the metal contacts that hold the batteries cracked and the speaker would only screach loudly so for me the contacts need to work on Rene L
,,Amazon Customer,WOW! Really?,16 Mar 2013,5.0 ,"I can not get over how well this speaker performs! I was not expecting this kind of performance out if such a small, portable, and inexpensive speaker! Best money I have ever spent on audio."
,,Booker DeWitt,You Get What You Pay For,18 Jun 2013,3.0 ,"This is a nice speaker, for the price. Does not really have much range and has a somewhat hollow sound."
,,Zacharias,The little Jewel,24 Aug 2013,4.0 ,I really like this little jewel. I only wish I could get a little more volume from it with out it breaking up and though for what it is I like the sound but would like a little more brightness to the sound.
,,crazypants,Works well.,18 Jun 2014,5.0 ,"Shipped quickly. Good volume from iPod while wife and I play tennis. Easy to use, seems fairly durable as well. Good bass."
,,BB,Perfect,18 Dec 2012,5.0 ,Perfect for travel. Great sound. Awesome little pouch for travel. So handy and better than anything else on the market.
,,JT,Well worth purchase...,14 Dec 2011,5.0 ,"I was looking for a speaker that was powered by batteries, and had a small footprint. This speaker met both criteria. What I didn't expect was the LARGE sound that it produced. Great product for what it is, but bear in mind, this isn't a home surround sound speaker system. Highly recommend!"
,,Kindle Customer,FABULOUS SOUND!!!,18 Nov 2011,5.0 ,THIS LITTLE SPEAKER HAS AMAZING SOUND. MY KIDS LIKE IT SO MUCH I CAN NEVER FIND IT-THEY HAVE IT ALL THE TIME!! WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYBODY!

,,Carol,Better than expected.,12 Jul 2013,5.0 ,Bought it for camping. Sounds great. Is loud enough to enjoy but does not bother others not near the speaker. Extremely happy with this product for the price!
,,Michael D. Tennant,Compact and Portable,01 Apr 2015,5.0 ,Very compact and portable. I take this on multi-day underground camp trips while surveying caves.

,,Kim,Great value,10 Feb 2013,5.0 ,Puts out a good amount of volume for how small it is. Works great with my iphone. Very happy with it!
,,donald mendelson,volume,04 Jan 2014,2.0 ,"I know this is a cheap speaker, but the volume was way too low to really be of much use for music. bought a bluetooth instead."
,,STarby,Altec Lansing iM-237 Orbit,20 Aug 2009,5.0 ,"This little baby is a wonder! The best speaker I've heard and at a price like this I bought 2!! One I put away for my son for a Christmas gift. I told my Uncle and he bought 2. I'm considering buying one for my husband for Christmas too. I keep it in my pocketbook all the time, you never know when you'll be using it and the case that it comes with is ideal!"
,,Dst,drT,28 Oct 2011,3.0 ,Great sound quality. Could be a bit smaller. The case is nice. It has good battery life. It's only problem is the very short cord which makes it very difficult to use with the iPad. Also the plug is a bit tricky to use.
,,Shonari,Big Sound from a Small Package!,08 Aug 2011,5.0 ,Price was reasonable but i was a bit skeptical about how it would sound. The minute it up to my iPod and hit play the skepticism was gone! Now i can play my ipod on the beach without having to rely on the earbuds and i can have a mini party on the go! Wish that the battery was rechargeable but the AAAs work fine
,,Adam Petrone,Big sound in a small package!,11 Dec 2009,5.0 ,Not much to say other than I love this speaker. I use it everyday either on my netbook or for my Zune HD. The sound is loud and crisp. Well made unit. I use rechargable batteries so the battery issue is not a problem to me. I would say it will play around 16 hours on a set. Don't think twice for the size and money there's nothing better out there.
,,Moviefan,Very nice speaker,16 Sep 2013,5.0 ,This speaker has amazing sound for its size. Perfect for watching videos on your smartphone. Runs many hours on 3 AAA batteries. Power indicator is green and turns red when batteries are low.
,,Carissa Lynch,Love this loud little speaker!,06 Feb 2010,5.0 ,This speaker is so little and portable but the sound is excellent! I even used it in my laptop to make the sound better. I recommend it!
,,Lightpainter,Little Speaker for MP3,03 Dec 2012,4.0 ,This is a sweet little speaker for the money. I gave it to my son in law to use at work.
,,Greg Greenlee,Love this speaker,14 May 2010,5.0 ,I use this speaker on my deck every evening while grilling. Have been using for nearly a month and have not changed batteries yet. I had stopped using my ipod because I disliked the earphones. This speaker has allowed me to enjoy my music and podcasts in a way I am much more used to. I will be buying this item for Christmas presents this year.
,,Gerhart Hauptman-diaz,Bad,14 Dec 2012,1.0 ,"This was okay for when I opened it and listened to it at first, but then the case would push the button by accident and drain the battery and it eventually became distorted and blew out. I ended up getting a Jambox which is 100x better."
,,Cubilas,Sounds good,09 Jan 2013,3.0 ,"I was expecting too much for such a small speaker, but this one really sounds nice! Good for your multimedia device, combined stereo into mono. Price was OK, seems like there's less expensive options out there."
,,Aunt Slappy,Great Speaker,19 Aug 2011,5.0 ,"This is a great little speaker. I have used it with my smart phone, mp3 player and laptop, basically any media devices that accepts a 3.5mm plug. The sounds from this little speaker have been more than impressive. I definitely would recommend this speaker to my friends."
,,Amazon Customer,Nice sound,19 Jun 2012,5.0 ,I bought this speaker to put on my invalid mother's overbed table. I attach it to an ipod or tape player so she can hear her tapes or digital books. It's small size is a plus. I feel the sound from this speaker in incredibly good. One of my best purchases.

,,Paul Kaiser,Awesome,21 May 2013,5.0 ,Great product!! If you want great sound get a splitter and hook up two of these for a great portable sound system.
,,M. Krogh,Pleasantly surprised.,17 May 2010,5.0 ,This speaker is just what we were looking for. The sound quality is great for such a small speaker. It is loud enough to use in our backyard and on camping trips. We really love it. I would recommend it to anyone looking to take their tunes out to share with others.
,,Kurt Foote,The battery compartment doesn't hold the batteries in place well ...,26 May 2015,2.0 ,"The battery compartment doesn't hold the batteries in place well, so they often disconnect when handling the speaker, which obviously shuts off the power."
,,Christopher Ekholm,Excellent Sound Quality,17 Feb 2010,5.0 ,"This speaker has surprisingly good overall sound for its size. Doesn't sound ""tinny"" or weak even on music with heavy bass. I was especially pleased with a side-by-side comparison I did with this speaker and the X-Mini MAX II ""egg-style"" speaker set. The Altec Lansing sounded much better and is considerably cheaper."
,,Lynne in CO,"Nice, clear sounding speaker!",22 Dec 2010,5.0 ,"Just got this little speaker for my iPod and it sounds fabulous! The sound is very clear and crisp. And it can be quite loud - I have to turn the volume way down on my iPod so it doesn't bother my coworkers. Impressive! And the little carrying case is a plus, too."
,,Bookity,Great little speaker,24 May 2011,4.0 ,This is a wonderful little speaker for mp3 players and smart phones. Very portable and easy to use. Not superior sound quality but very good for the price! I take it everywhere + can't wait for the beach!

,,Albert P. Gonzales,"apg ,phoenix",26 Oct 2009,4.0 ,i just bought this speaker(2)for my son and myself for various activities outdoors and the sound is clear and wish it would be louder but it works great when relaxing outside
,,Estebandido,Great AT FIRST,20 Jul 2011,1.0 ,I bought this product from Amazon to accompany me on a trip abroad. For about the first week I was delighted then it refused to produce any sound. I replaced the batteries - still no sound. I just looked up the price $30. I can't believe I spent so much money on what became a totally WORTHLESS product. I left it with some friends hoping that they might be able to find someone to repair the Altec speaker. I assumed it was a bargain speaker that would hardly be worth sending back. WAS I WRONG!!! Don't waste your money on this miserable product.
,,cnjlaw,Altec Lansing iM-237 Orbit Ultraportable Speaker,05 Jan 2011,5.0 ,I got this for my husband and he loves it. It has great sound for such little speaker and it is incredibly portable.
,,L. Zehl,LOVE IT! ALTEC LANSING iM-237 SPEAKER,21 Aug 2010,5.0 ,I am so glad I found this little speaker!!! I can listen to my ipod at work now without using my annoying ear buds!

Great deal at a reasonable price!
,,W. Craft..,Actually Sounds Good,29 Sep 2010,5.0 ,This inexpensive speaker is handy when you would prefer not to use earphones. The sound quality is good and the price is right.
,,Amazon Customer,The reviews do not lie!,27 Dec 2011,5.0 ,"I purchased this speaker based on the reviews I have read, and they do not lie. This little speaker produces some of the best sound for a portable device! The only complaint I have is the case feels ""cheap"". It's plastic and that is what makes it feel cheap, other than that, there is no issue!"
,,Travelerpm,ALTEC LANSING SPEAKER REVIEW,20 Apr 2013,5.0 ,WE RECEIVED THE ALTEC LANSING SPEAKER IN EXCELLENT CONDITION AND IT WORKS GREAT! WE USE IT FOR PARANORMAL INVESTIGATIONS (SAME ONE THAT ZAK USES ON GHOST ADVENTURES). PROBABLY NOT IDEAL FOR LISTENING TO MUSIC - BUT IT WORKS GREAT FOR WHAT WE USED IT FOR!
,,Rob,use it at work,08 Dec 2011,4.0 ,I bought this for work when streaming music from my phone... it's pretty loud and surprisingly durable batteries do go quick

,,D. Sinclair,Great little speaker!,22 Feb 2012,5.0 ,"This is a great little speaker. It is sturdy plastic case with a metal grill over the actual speaker membrane. It has surprisingly good sound for a small, single speaker. I would definitely recommend this to someone looking for an upgrade to their phone speaker."
,,Texas banker,Altec Lansing IM-237 Portable speaker,08 Dec 2010,4.0 ,"I've had this speaker for about a year. Absolutely love it. Take with me on out of town trips so I can listen to Pandora or other music from my Iphone. Very clean sound. Although no speaker this small will deliver much bass, at least you know it is there with this little unit. Excellent value for the money!"
,,ricky77333,"Uh, fairly good",18 Jul 2011,4.0 ,The speaker is a little above average for sound. No volume control. I'm not sure if I would buy another. Like I said - a bit above average.
,,Norman Lake,Bluetooth,30 Sep 2013,2.0 ,This item was listed under the bluetooth section and should not have been as it is not.I did not realise that this item has to be plugged in to your computing device.Listed in wrong section.
,,Preciousone,The Atlec Lansing iM227 Orbit MP3 Speaker works well.,04 Jul 2013,4.0 ,"The only problem with this The Atlec Lansing iM227 Orbit MP3 Speaker is the cord is too short. Otherwise, it work well and the sound is o.k. when I plug it it into my Kindle Fire or any Tablet."
,,John Faughnan,For the price - excellent.,12 Dec 2011,5.0 ,"I think I got these for some ridiculously low price, perhaps $10. I bought one for the kitchen, then one for each child as a stocking stuffer. Sounds decent, switch feels solid, short cable doesn't get in the way, feels fairly solid."
,,B. Getty,Great buy,02 May 2010,5.0 ,"This is a great speaker for portability. We live in the Green Mountains of Vermont and do a lot of hiking and camping. Great for overnight outdoor trips when you want some tunes. Battery life is great, it lasts about 8 hours. I bought three to date for kids and they love them. Comes in a little padded case with a caribiner."
,,Bryan Grigg,Loud for a personal speaker!,25 Jun 2011,5.0 ,"Very pleased, it was exactly what I wanted. Loud enough for the kids to hear the a DVD in car when the speaker is plugged into our laptop. Loud on my kindle and Iphone4. Great little speaker! It even comes with three energizer batteries, I think I was more surprised about that than anything :)"
,,Randy,great sound small package,11 Jun 2011,5.0 ,I was very pleasantly surprised when I started using this speaker. It has great sound and very good battery life. I would highly recomend this item for portability and quality of sound. I can not say enough good things about my altec speaker. Randy
,,Ron B.,Ron's review,24 Apr 2011,5.0 ,Excellent product for use with iPad. Great sound and battery life. Only negative is the short 8 inch connection cable. So short you cannot even rotate the iPad from portrait to landscape without problems. Strongly recommend you order a audio extension cable with the product!
,,Amazon Customer,Alright.,06 Apr 2015,3.0 ,"For the price and brand name, i expected a bigger sound. But it's well built."
,,James,some downfalls,22 Mar 2013,3.0 ,"Speaker sound quality is good...but not great... biggest problem is NO volume control on the speaker. For a speaker this expensive, it should at least have a volume control. It also eats batteries very quickly (3 AAA batteries about every 4 hours or so)."
,,coggart,Mini speaker,24 Nov 2012,5.0 ,An amazing little device -- perfect for dancers to practice to. The back side is difficult to unscrew though. Not impossible...just difficult. When the battery charge becomes low...the sound becomes fuzzy.
,,KritiK,Amazing sound,03 Dec 2011,4.0 ,"For such a small speaker, it produces amazing sound. 3 AAA batteries and you are ready to go. I have an inexpensive GoVibe and it sounds great. You should turn off the equalizer to get the best performance."
,,Mr. MacDaddy,For the size.....can't be beat,07 Apr 2011,5.0 ,"The second one I've purchased. My daughter fell in love with the first one and I never got it back. Sounds good and very handy for the office, porch, etc. Excellent value and great carrying case. Thanks Altec and Amazon."
,,Samuel B. Wilbur,Awesome sound for a small speaker,03 May 2012,5.0 ,Can't believe how good this sounds compared to other small travel speakers I have owned. Well worth the price. Just try to make sure it doesnt get accidentally turned on in your luggage...= dead battery. Best to remove batteries when in transit.

,,Arnep,Nice portable speaker,04 Jan 2011,4.0 ,"This little speaker provides excellent quality sound, particularly given its small size. I wish the controls to turn it on were in a format that would avoid turning it on by mistake, but so far this has not happened to me, so perhaps it will not be a problem. I also like the fact that it will fit any size/type MP3."
,,K. C. Thomas,Can't be beat for the price...could charge quite a bit more for the quality!,30 Sep 2011,5.0 ,"Purchased this to work with our IPad and IPhone for vacation. Now that we are back we use it regularly. Great battery life, great sound, and obviously super portable...Love it!"

The sound is incredible- much better than what I expected. The carrying case is a nice plus- albeit it does fit a little too snug. Great value- highly recommend.
,,Upstart,Nice portable speaker,15 Jul 2011,5.0 ,"I needed a really portable speaker for my smartphone for when we travel, mainly camping. This one does exactly what the listing stated. It's so easy to use and I'm very please with the sound. I'd like to have a longer connection cord but I'm sure I can find a extension cable."
,,F. Wantuch,Great things come in small packages,02 Mar 2010,5.0 ,"I purchased this portable speaker to go along with my Mp3 player, the first thing that I noticed was it has great sound for it's size it will fill an average room up with some good clear music, the batery life is very good also for 3 AAA batteries, so far everyone that has listened to it they were impressed with it's sound quality."
,,Brandon,Great little speaker,04 Dec 2011,5.0 ,"I originally bought this for myself, but the wife has taken it over. She is always listening to it. It is well worth the money and the batteries last a long time. She plays it non stop and I believe she has only changed the batteries once, and they weren't even dead."
,,TheJoshHarding,Love it! Love it! Great sound and small enough to easily take with you!,05 Jan 2012,5.0 ,"Fantastic sound for the price! Nice and small so you can take it with you to the pool, or add a sound boost to a laptop on the go! Fantastic!"
,,brett c,Great iphone beach/pool accessory,29 Oct 2010,5.0 ,Works great with iPhone while at the pool. Speaker in iPhone is not loud enough to be heard outdoors. If you want a nice simple solution to bring to pool/beach in a small package this is the answer!
,,S. Ray,perfect little speaker,16 Nov 2010,5.0 ,"This item is exactly what i wanted,, very good sound quality,, loud enough for office, bedroom, bath settings.. is not going to shake the walls by any means, but plenty loud small areas and personal listening.

,,Martiniour,Good little speaker,14 Feb 2009,5.0 ,We bought this for our babies room and it works well. While not over powering it is loud enough for the children to enjoy and compact enough to move around the house.
,,Amy,Perfect!,30 Jun 2009,5.0 ,"This speaker is just what the doctor ordered. It's small enough to clip to my belt loop. It could fit into a pocket, but they would have to be big, cargo style pockets. The sound is great for such a small speaker. The only thing that would make it better is if the plug cord to my ipod were a little longer."
,,Ken S.,Bought as a gift,11 Jun 2014,4.0 ,I purchased this as a stocking stuffer and was impressed with the sound coming from such a small unit. Great portable speaker.
,,Gregory K,Great speaker for iPod/MP3 player & laptops,27 Jun 2009,5.0 ,Great little battery powered speaker for iPod and laptop.

,,Monica Bevill,"Great ""little"" speaker!",13 Apr 2011,5.0 ,"This little speaker sounds great!! It's small enough to fit in my purse but loud enough to listen to in my house. It is wonderful!!! The price had been marked down from $39.95 to $22.41. I don't know that I would pay $40, but I can see it being worth $25."

,,Seattle98144,Great speaker for a modest price.,14 Apr 2012,5.0 ,"I've had this product for about 3 months, and it's worked incredibly well. I use it in the AM to listen to podcasts, and later in the day to listen to music. The volume and frequency-response are excellent. It's portable and durable."
,,Linda B.,Altec Lansing Orbit Speaker,02 Oct 2013,5.0 ,"Picked this speaker because I saw it on Ghost Adventures used with the spirit box, but it also hooks up to the digital voice recorder to amplify Evp's works great, very clear sound. Love it"

,,Mary K.,It's nice if it works,28 Sep 2010,1.0 ,"I read the reviews of this speaker, but decided to take a chance on it. Poor decision. 1. The battery case is really hard to get back on, as other reviewers mentioned. 2. The sound is pretty good considering it's size - not a lot of volume, but functional. 3. The worst thing was that I was only able to use it for a couple of hours before the sound went out completely. I didn't get the screeching others have mentioned, but it completely stopped working. I was using it with an iPad. Don't waste you money on this speaker."
,,R. McNeil,Good product at a good price,28 Dec 2009,4.0 ,"I've been very happy with this little speaker. Very portable and battery life is pretty long. I use it in the car to play my iPod. As another user commented, the on/off button on the side is a bit unprotected and therefore can sometimes be inadvertently turned on or off. That would be my only hesitation in purchasing again."
,,Kahaluu,Works great,30 Aug 2010,5.0 ,"My car does not have an ipod aux cable, so this was just a lot easier to use than the adapter. Perfect"
,,rob,Great sound,31 Jul 2011,5.0 ,My wife and I plug our Smart Phones into this easy to use little speaker/ player and hear quality music from our media storage for hours poolside.

,,D. Holness,Great Buy,06 Dec 2009,4.0 ,"I would highly recommend this product, gives volume through the ipod but is pretty loud and is everything i expectd . only minus points the lead could be a wee bit longer that goes to the Ipod otherwise its wonderful and serves the purpose of having music for the beach or in the office without taking up too much space."

,,Tinybear,Amazing speakers for the size,02 Feb 2011,5.0 ,These speakers are probably the best sounding speakers for the size. Just had a BBQ at a friend's place and the speakers impressed everybody. We all took turns plugging in our iPhones or Android devices and playing the music we wanted. They were really great for the portability.
,,Dino Smith,Good sound quality. No option for AC power or powered by the source,19 May 2011,3.0 ,Good sound quality for such a small unit. I am looking a speaker for sleeping purpose. I can not turn off the speaker with a battery powered speaker after the music is over or i fall asleep. The speaker is too loud for me. I used to have a pair of tiny speakers (embedded into the pillow at the time of the purchase). My tiny speakers were 10 time smaller than the one I received (Altec Lansing iM-237). Only the person head rested on the pillow can heard the music and no extra power source required.
,,Kuntry Boi,Altec Lansing im227 speaker,06 May 2012,5.0 ,"Incredible sound for such a compact speaker. Was initially worried about battery life, but battery life turned out to be great! Purchased for my wife to use with her cell phone when she plays music. Will soon be ordering one for myself!"

,,waltwiso,Altec Lansing iM227,22 Jun 2013,4.0 ,"Elecllent little speaker for my SP-7 Spirit Box that I use for paranormal investigations. It increases the sound so much, that it is easier to understand the words comming out of the Spirit Box. Delaware City Ghost Hunters"

,,Gibson S.,Exceeded expectations.,04 Nov 2013,4.0 ,"Great sound, but the pins that hold the battery in need adjusting. The sound has gradually gotten softer, but with how much I use it, its to be expected. Certainly exceeded my expectations."
,,ChrisF,Pleasantly Pleased,04 Aug 2010,4.0 ,"After reading many reviews on this site I decided to purchase this speaker. I pulled it out of the box, popped three AAA batteries into it and, WOW, I was immediately impressed. This speaker is impressive given it's small size and battery vs. AC operation. Much more than I had expected."
,,Ellen in DC,"Good sound, short cord.",31 Jul 2015,5.0 ,Very good sound for size. Cord should be longer. Prefer Bluetooth now so no cord issues.
,,Jose,The audio cable comes loose,21 Jan 2014,2.0 ,The cable connection between the speaker and the audio device is loose and sometimes you lose sound. Overpriced junk imo.
,,Dan Pitt,Works Fine,17 Apr 2013,3.0 ,"Works fine but you can buy bluetooth ones for about the same price and sound quality, Altec Lansing makes some good products."
,,Krissy,Great Speaker,06 Jan 2013,5.0 ,Bought this speaker almost 3 years ago and its still going strong. Over the years we have connected this speaker to MP3 players and ipods. Great sounding speaker!

,,Craig Carlson,Good but not great,04 Nov 2013,3.0 ,Does not live up to the majority of reviews I read. Sounds just a little mushy which says something about the amp inside it. It's good but not great.
,,LB,GREAT LITTLE SPEAKER!,21 Oct 2009,5.0 ,"My husband loves this speaker. He actually had the previous model, but when I purchased the new Ipod Nano 5th Generation, he saw this new model with the on/off switch and wanted this one. Great for portability and sounds great! He can work set this up with his Ipod and no worries. Battery lasts a long time also!"
,,ffemt,Great product for the money. I give it 5 stars.,24 Apr 2011,5.0 ,"Great speaker for even 2x the price. The only thing I would change is adding a few more inches to the cord length. This can be solved on your own, however. BUY IT"
,,The Man that Reviews,They shipped me a corpse device than an actual eletronic.,02 Nov 2011,1.0 ,"You know what they say: ""You only get the best quality, if you want to pay more"" Got this in today and I seriously recommend that you DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM. Trust me, you do not want to spend 12 bucks on this. Here's the scenario: I come home from school and found out my package had arrived from Amazon. I got the orders I wanted, including the iM227 Speaker. I opened it, kept the paperwork within, inserted batteries into the speaker and tested it with my mp3 Sansa clip. However, nothing but a wobbling sound and a very, VERY, low sound coming out from the speaker. I Ignored it thinking it'll get any better, but no it hasn't. Stayed the same and tried to get the desired sound it advertised, but nothing but whispers of my Sansa clip. Pissed off, I went onto the computer, looking for any trouble shooting and reviewing the item that you see me typing right now. So please and I ADVISE you. DON'T RISK IT. My expectations for this were thought to be great, until it died."

,,R. Mills,Nice Portable Speaker for a Smaartphone,18 Aug 2011,4.0 ,"Altec Lansing is quality. The sound is good. The 3.5mm jack cord is way too short. No volume control on the speaker. Uses 3 AAA batteries, lasts forever. Overall, decent speaker"

,,Lili,Great little speaker,25 Dec 2011,5.0 ,"This little speaker is perfect. The sound is great. The auxiliary cord is a little short, but you could always add an extension - if really needed. The case is a must have. Keeps it protected when traveling. Definitely a good buy!"
,,CB,Portable speaker,01 Oct 2012,4.0 ,So far so good. The sound is decent for such a small speaker. About what I hoped for when I ordered it. Hopefully it travels well and keeps doing its job.
,,E. K. Moseley,Great,19 Feb 2009,5.0 ,Altec did this almost prefect; I wound only suggest that they make the sound cord a few inches longer and possibly let it run off the computer or iPod. I love having the lighted on/off button that is a soft ease touch. High quality sound comes from this very small speaker. I love it. I highly recommend. 5 stars.
,,Lily Rose,Really Pleased,17 Jul 2011,5.0 ,"I was really pleased and surprised by the sound quality when I plugged this into my ipod. The sound is quite good for its size, and it's a really good value for the price. Comes with a cute travel container which should make it easier for portability."

,,Stephen W. Douglas,Nice performance for a small footprint,04 Sep 2011,4.0 ,"The speaker is compact enough and perfect for the intent. I use it to augment Pandora and mp3. Perfect for the office.

,,JB,Great little speaker,05 Feb 2012,5.0 ,This little speaker is perfect and plenty loud. We use it to plug into our mp3 players and can carry it throughout the house to provide music in any room. Also is loud enough to have playing while working out at home instead of having to wear ear phones.

,,Greg Reager,Biggest piece of crap ever,16 Mar 2012,1.0 ,"I was not thrilled to discover that this thing is all plastic. The batteries would not fit snug in the battery compartment, they would fall out with little effort and then thing would not power on after using it once. Biggest piece of crap DO NOT BUY."
,,marlinspiker,Sounds great,02 Mar 2013,4.0 ,Better than others we have had. Batteries last an adequate amount of time but would be better with a plug option as well. For this reason it only gets 4 stars.
,,RAMIREZ,They need to improve!,21 Apr 2012,2.0 ,i think the price is kind of high for the product they should try to improve the quality of the product and then the price would be good but for me im unhappy it wasnt as good as i thought it would be for the price..
,,Ireke,why bother,25 Nov 2011,1.0 ,"Based on the multiple reviews on site of this and similar speakers, I got this to boost my computer, which has always had crappy feedback. I can't even tell that it exists. Maybe that is because of how I am using it, but I may as well not be using it at all-even when held to my ear, it makes no difference whatsoever to the sound volume!"
,,Gregory S. Nicklas,Altec Portable Speaker - Good product,01 Feb 2010,4.0 ,Great speaker for the price. Good sound for the size of speaker and very portable. Everything that I could have expected for a speaker this small. Only improvement would be to make it re-chargeable instead of requiring AAA batteries.
,,scott johnston,Five Stars,18 May 2015,5.0 ,Awesome - no other words. I bought a second one.
,,Marc David Johnson,Surprised,27 Oct 2011,5.0 ,"I read the reviews and decided to give it a shot. For close to twenty bucks, this speaker packs some decent sound. Perfect for a portable or a work desktop. Don't expect audiophile sound, but it IS very good for the price. Quite happy."

,,James R. Miller,Good Value for the Price,24 May 2010,4.0 ,"I use this speaker with my laptop and MP3 player. It's very easy to carry and attach to either device. For for such a small speaker it puts out good quality undistorted sound. If you want something really loud I'd go with a bigger speaker, but for my uses it is ideal."
,,renny,little speaker huge sound,07 Oct 2011,5.0 ,Wow..wow..wow.this thing is awesome I can't believe what comes out of this thing and the price holy crap what a deal get it you won't be sorry .....try putting this thing in the corner of the bathroom ..it gets even louder

,,DonTheTraveler,It's a really nice speaker,11 Aug 2012,5.0 ,"It's nice and works as advertised and the only negative point I would make is the tiny, only about 10"" speaker lead. It would not add very much to make it about 24"" long."
,,al,Good purchase.,18 Dec 2014,5.0 ,Nice small size. Good sound quality. Would buy it again.

,,eliz,Five Stars,09 Aug 2014,5.0 ,Excellent sound. This is my second one and I use it at home and when I travel.
,,Phong,This is a near-perfect mini portable speaker!,04 Apr 2013,5.0 ,"I have been waiting for this speaker's price hit at least around the $20 range and it finally did on Amazon. So, I instantly bought it because I've really kept my eyes on it for the past few months. When I finally tried the speakers let me just say, it blew me away. This little speaker was almost Bose-like quality; it almost captured the mids, lows, and highs of every song I've played. Also, the product didn't feel too cheap. The only downside about the speaker that does kind of disappoints me a lot is the distortion it reaches when it gets to that maximum volume of your music player. But then again, this was $20. Probably one of the best $20 I've spent. Pros: Clarity Portability Price Descent bass Loud enough Cons: Powered from AAA batteries Distortion So, I truly recommend this speaker to anyone that asks for the best mini portable speaker in the market. Especially, people who loves jazz and bass-driven music."

,,Ron S.,Short cord.,02 Sep 2013,4.0 ,Love the speaker and the sound is terrific. The only draw back is the cord is really too short. Need to make the cord 3 to 4 feet long.
,,J. Mork,yet it delivers nice sound from my Samsung cell phone,09 Sep 2014,5.0 ,"So inexpensive, yet it delivers nice sound from my Samsung cell phone."

After two songs it starts to screech. I ordered another one and the same thing happened. I haven't tried to contact Lansing yet. It seems others had no success getting a refund.
,,Rick Ziegler,"Works great, but no volume control",20 Apr 2014,4.0 ,"It's great, very loud, very clear. But it would have been nice if it had it's own independent volume control."
,,Mike,Simply amazing little gadget,18 Sep 2011,5.0 ,"First test was a little disappointing - sound is loud but quality so-so. After the installation of drivers (23474_Virtual_Surround_Driver_Windows.rar or 02-0391C.zip - just Google them), the sound is amazing ( as for my ear :))."
,,David A. Campbell,Great little speaker,14 Jul 2011,5.0 ,"I love this speaker for my phone. Great, compact setup with incredible sound from such a small speaker. Batteries seem to last forever too. I've listened to Pandora for hours on end and am still on my first set."
,,Helen D. Walters,Altec Lansing iM227 Orbit MP3 Speaker,07 Dec 2012,5.0 ,"I thought this was a very clever idea. I use it for my MP3 player outside and all around the house when not on my dock, and for a little speaker, it has a pretty good sound."
,,amaze122,I Loved this speaker!,06 Apr 2010,5.0 ,"Everyone at my job (I work at a hospital pharmacy) was Blown Away by the sound of this little speaker. The quality is crisp and clear, and Very good bass response. When I told them the price, Everyone wanted to go out and buy one right away..."

,,Starr Goldberg,My light new speaker,22 Mar 2010,5.0 ,I love the fact that I can move around so easily with the speaker that fits in one hand. One caveat: I forgot to turn it off.

,,SWS,Good sound. Decent price. Battery not rechargeable.,12 Nov 2012,3.0 ,Good sound. Decent price. Battery not rechargeable. It should come with rechargeable batteries. 4 set of recharges on new batteries equal the cost of this speaker.
,,Antonio Patino C,Worst speaker ever!!!!,11 Jun 2012,1.0 ,"I received this little speaker hoping that it was a good buy. Altec Lansing has always been a good speaker company and I thought, hey, this is a good brand, this could be a great product and I was looking for some companion to my iPod touch. Well, I was wrong in everything I thought, I placed the batteries and connected to my gadget and it worked flawlessly, don't expect this to sound like those big speakers, this is more like a headphone but with bass. The speaker where ok for two days, but today I was just playing music and then, surprise, DEAD, believe it or not, this piece of trash stopped working and after changing batteries, trying with two iPhones, one blackberry, they are completely DEAD. Good product Altec Lansing, best 25 bucks I have spent."

,,IrishMom,Junk,10 Mar 2014,1.0 ,"the sound is terrible, I just wanted it to watch my ipad a little louder than the ipad speaker, but the sound is distorted. They have a 30 day return policy on this product for a reason! because shortly after the thirty days, the on/off button was stuck in the on position. so when you want to turn it off you have to take out the batteries. It also eats up batteries very quickly. i thought it would be cheap and cheerful - it turned out to be cheap and junky."
,,Mesc,Sorry for the volume during your swing....,04 Apr 2011,5.0 ,Got this for my golf cart to get rid of headphone issues. I velcroed this screamer to the cart and it jams!

Thankfully that finally stopped, but now it doesn't work at all."

,,George,Nice Speaker; cord too short,12 Jan 2009,4.0 ,"I agree with the other reviewers, the speaker has good sound, is portable and works great with my ipod touch. My only complaint is that the cord is too short. Another 6 inches of cord would have made this an even better product."

,,eroz,Little Speaker Big Sound,26 Apr 2012,5.0 ,"I use the Altec Lansing iM227 Orbit speaker mainly when we go on vacation, with my Dell DJ and Asus Prime Tablet. For its size, it delivers a quality sound and unbelievable volume."
,,GG1,"Great little speaker, needs some refinements",03 Jul 2009,3.0 ,"I actually love this little speaker. It provides pretty good sound at an affordable price. BUT...the clips that hold the batteries in aren't big enough. I've found that all AAA batteries are not EXACTLY the same size, and the clips in every other device make up for it but in this speaker, some of my batteries won't even work because they are just a touch shorter than the rest. And even the ones that work can get reseated easily, and I'll have to open the cover and adjust them. Kind of annoying. :-("

,,Ryder,High Quality sound at a fantastic price.,06 Apr 2012,5.0 ,"This speaker, without a doubt, puts out better sound quality than much larger speakers. Connected to my IPod it sounds as good if not better than my Bose IPod player."
,,tnts7433,NICE,16 Jan 2011,4.0 ,I did not know what to expect but wanted something small to use in the office and use on trips. I also wanted good sound. This does all of that. Amazon offered a good price on a good item and I am glad I bought the Altec Lansing speaker.
,,willy,Lots of sound,20 Sep 2010,5.0 ,I needed a speaker to plug into my IPOD when I'm entertaining folks around my fire pit. These work so well I don't need to crank the volume. Batteries lasts a long time.

,,Lorna J. Christensen,Great for my classroom infocus projector,26 May 2013,4.0 ,This speaker works very well. The only disadvantage is the cord to plug into the computer/ipad outlet isn't very long.
,,SC,Underpowered,16 Dec 2013,2.0 ,It's difficult to hear - not enough projection. Very good price but I'm going to buy something else as this is definitely not loud enough.
,,Clark W,Broke on 3rd Use,26 Dec 2011,1.0 ,Used it all of three times and the third time there was massive feedback whenever I tried to use it. Same issue whether connecting it to an iPhone or a laptop. Basically a waste of $45.

,,A. Big Belly,disappointed!,19 Nov 2011,2.0 ,"there are couple of reasons that made me return this after doing my own comparison with the other 3 portable speakers competitors(iHome & xmini II) & ayl) : 1) its BIG! people were writing how this speaker has the best sound in comparison with the other speakers! its like compering apples and oranges. If this is bigger than the other speakers then the sound intensity has to be louder, its common sense. But actually its not that much of a different. 2) It uses AAA batteries! really! 3) you wont get quality sound at high volume. 4) really thin and cheap cord out put 5) ugly design bottom line: there are better speakers at the same price range and better quality"

,,Chip,Best portable speaker out,15 Apr 2011,5.0 ,This little speaker rocks. This is my second speaker. I bought my first one 4yrs ago and have used it a ton. Three triple A battery's last about 16 hrs at full volume. Recently tried the new jawbone jambox and was very disappointed. I was so disappointed that I thought for sure there had to be a problem with it because this little speaker side by side would blow the jawbone away. So I returned the jawbone and got another one. Same thing. This $40 speaker kicks the $200 speakers butt. Highly recommend this product.
,,Erin,disappointed,02 May 2015,1.0 ,Malfunctioned almost immediately.
,,Santa,Just What I Wanted with Mac Book Air,02 Dec 2009,5.0 ,"There is plenty written here already. My laptop is inaudible with movies. It is also small on purpose. I don't want sound bigger than the computer. Put simply, this works great. Laptop owners: get one."

,,jasonlee,speaker makes loud screeching sound when you turn ipod up half way,29 May 2011,1.0 ,"I ordered this product and it did not work well right away. Once I turn my ipod up more then half way, the speaker makes a loud screeching sound. You can unplug the ipod and the speaker will continue to make the sound until you hit the power button. The screeching sound is 10x louder then the music playing. I tried the speaker out on a few iPods and phones... each time the same thing happened. I returned the first speaker thinking it was damaged or flawed. The second speaker sent to me did the same exact thing."
,,Penn State 29,Good little speaker,19 Jan 2013,4.0 ,Works much better than some of the other Kindle speakers. Good value for money. Not a lot of power but for money works well.
,,A. DeLuca,Not too bad,26 Dec 2011,3.0 ,The sound quality is acceptable but not phenomenal. Its great for a low key sound system but not loud enough to really blast music. Its a good size for portability though.
,,Tyler,"good quality speaker, fairly good volume and sound",18 Nov 2011,5.0 ,"good quality for the price, there is only one button - on and off, volume control is through your mp3 device. Surprisingly good sound for the size of the speaker."

,,M. Maxwell,Better than the previous version,06 Jul 2011,5.0 ,"It handles loud and bass better than the previous version. Also, the buttons are easier to deal with. I miss having the travel case, though."
,,Amazon Customer,Sad end,14 Jun 2011,1.0 ,"This was fine while it lasted. After three weeks of use, it now crackles and complains when connected....too bad."
,,Frank,Batteries,03 Jun 2013,2.0 ,The battery cover always falls out and the batteries don't connect very well so it will just stop working at random times.
,,James H. Ha,Needs better quality contro for this brand name,25 Apr 2011,1.0 ,"This product itself was not bad, that's why I ordered again after I misplaced it. But second one I tried after I came back from long mission trip from Cambodia, I found that speaker must be torn inside or something wrong because I couldn't raise volume at all due to noise. This time I will return it and try other Altec product. But it's very disappointing for this poor quality control."

My iPod was fully discharged after going through one series of songs on an album. I think this is the fault of the iPod because the iM-237 has its own power. I would recommend it because it does what it promised to do."

It didn't crack or anything, it just didn't work anymore - no power at all. At least we got a week of music out of it - it just didn't fulfill its original purpose, which was to go on vacation with us."
,,Ben Lerner,Excellent for the price,02 May 2009,5.0 ,This little speaker provides very clear and accurate sound. The volume level is good. A useful carrying case (the same size as the speaker) is also provided. There are no batteries in the package though.

,,Rowdy,Cord is too short,09 Jan 2011,4.0 ,I liked everything about this speaker...........except the cord is only about six inches long. This means it has to be immediately next to your music source.

,,raul zadon,away from the grid speakers,15 Mar 2011,5.0 ,so far so good. a nice heavy duty velcro patch on the bottom to help stabelize it for action sports would be an improvement. it looks tough. time will tell.
,,Expectant Customer,No stars if I could,10 May 2012,1.0 ,"I bought a few of these for around the house. All of them stopped working almost immediately. They sounded great for the money and for what they are initially. Unfortunately, within 24 hours of play later, all I got was static out of them. This was across all three I purchased."

,,PurpleMoonGirl,The sound was not that great but worked for what we needed it to,06 Jul 2016,3.0 ,"Average speaker. Stopped working all together after a few years, which is expected. the cord that plugged into the device was too short so that was always problematic.

,,Bobo The Great,Very good sound,11 Jun 2011,5.0 ,Connected to an ipad today to do some work around the house and the sound was very clear and loud. Nice speaker!
,,Brian,Could be better =(,05 Jul 2010,3.0 ,"This should have 5 stars. From the box it feels tough. Solid built. On/Off wont get clicked if it's in it's bag, the button is slightly recessed and needs to go pretty far in to turn the unit on. So when put away in it's bag I've had no problems with it coming on. It is possible tho. It holds 3 AAA batteries (i'd prefer AA or even another AAA for 4 ""you will never find a 3 pack of normal or rechargeable"" and they should have the room for them) They last a long time tho so thats nice. This unit puts out good sound. Yes in the instructions you are told to NOT turn up your volume of the device you are using above 80%..... Very good sound ""for this size of a speaker"" tho. It tries to do Bass but not really. It does 360 sound. So by now your asking yourself why the 1 star the unit seems great and I must a jerk it's only as 30$ speaker... How long it will last it up in the air due to this last part. The Aux cord is Hard wired. It's wrapped around the Battery compartment door and then clips into the center of the door. 1st The hard line coming out of the bottom of the speaker has to do a 90 degree bend to then wrap around the battery door. There is nothing you can do, it's forced to kink like this over and over. 2ed Then to top it off when it's fully wrapped around the door and the Aux jack has to clip into the battery door it has to do another 90 degree kink. So your cord has to be kinked and be bent over and over Each time you plug in your speaker to anything. In at least 2 spots at hard angles Only had it a few days. I haven't run though my 1st set of batteries and the cord is already coming loose and twisting the wire, Due to the way you are forced to store the Hard wired aux cord. Just from ""very carefully"" normal use, of putting the cord away maybe 10 times? Simple fix would be to have a Female Aux port that we can plug and unplug as used. And doing this could allow for a 4th AAA battery to make it even last longer (and be a even match to my 4 AAA rechargeable battery pack) This units Aux Cord will break pretty quick and make this unit useless."
,,cinnieb,Better than expected,02 Jan 2012,5.0 ,Really awesome little speaker. Fits in the cup holder on the golf cart. Good volume and tone. Very good buy.
,,Derek,Very Loud,14 Apr 2009,5.0 ,"It is surprisingly loud, even when close to the street, I could still hear it clearly. It even sounds better then my friends old Toyota's stock speakers."
,,Lila,Only lasted 2 months,11 Jun 2011,1.0 ,"I loved it when I first got it. Small, portable and sounded decent enough for the price. The instructions said to listen to it at 80% of the volume. Well, apparently that is because the speaker blows at a low-mid volume. I had this for 2 months, and loved it, then it just went kaputz. Yes, it ws only $25, but I expected it to last at least a year."
,,Mavilsa56,"Good sound, portable",31 Aug 2011,5.0 ,It has a really good sound and works in all fine. Only the length of cable it's a minor problem.

,,justanotherconsumer,Great sound,30 Mar 2011,5.0 ,I would say the only draw back is the short leash. The cord is only 7inches long. Still love it though.
,,M.J.Ebrahim,Small yet Powerful,10 Mar 2013,5.0 ,"Great compact speaker for your on the go travels. Very crisp and clear sound. Size is perfect but I wish it was rechargeable instead. Note: ""DO NOT"" an ""NEVER"" set the volume to the highest level."

,,taxpayer,Great sound-- while it lasted,25 Nov 2011,2.0 ,"I bought this over a year ago as a spare. Finally I needed it, opened the box, set it up, and it sounded great! Really much better than I would expect from such a small and inexpensive unit. However, after about a month, it simply stopped working. Just a very very faint sound if I put it right next to my ear. So I have had to buy another brand. My advice: If you buy it, start using it right away and check the warranty."
,,Anjum,Never buy this item,27 Nov 2010,1.0 ,"I bought this item to have a better/louder sound from my laptop. I plugged it to my laptop; it worked for a few second then a big static, you can't hear anything. I tried lowering the volume but nothing helped. I will not advise anyone to buy this item.

When i received them i was pleasantly surprised to see the sound strength and quality were far above my expectations, i feel i got a great product, the only thing that could be improved in the future is the possibility to hook up two of them and get Stereo sound."

,,Charles W. Christison,Nice sounds but no case.,02 Nov 2011,3.0 ,"I had previously purchased a IM237 for my macbook and have always like it. Solidly built, great case, great sounds. So after the purchase of my ipad I decided to revisit ALtect. I picked up this iM227 and was a little dissapointed. It does not come with the great case and solid feel. This is the lower quality cousin of the iM-237 that works with the ipad. Nice sound in this little unit but if you are looking for a more solid speaker, get the iM237. Chuck"
,,R. Baron,"Sound is OK, the cable is stupidly SHORT",30 May 2012,2.0 ,"The speaker and its sound is fine, too bad the designers came up with a stupidly short cable, so you have to get an extension cord, otherwise you would have to lay your iPad, iPod or iPhone right next to the unit and you could never watch a video. It's a design that was obviously never tested by anyone and the engineers blew it. Has anyone at the Company making this speaker ever heard of User Testing ??? - I doubt it - shame on them..."

,,John W.,Great Sound for a small speaker,31 Jan 2010,5.0 ,"Just add some batteries and plug it into your mp3 player and you have high quality sound. Obviously not stereo but good sound without any distortion even with the volume turned up. So far, battery life is better than expected."
,,Siegs,"Speaker cord is 5"" long",16 Aug 2012,1.0 ,"The cord that connects the speaker to the headphone jack is five inches long. Literally. Five inches. I'm sitting at my desk and can't place the speaker anywhere but almost on top of my laptop. This is a horrible, horrible design. I should be able to plug in the speaker to my laptop, and set up the speaker to the side of my desk, not just 5"" away. It's brutal."
,,EnriqueJ,Altec Lansing speaker,29 Oct 2010,1.0 ,"I just received my Altec Lansing iM-237 Orbit speaker and was very pleased with the sound quality, for about 15 seconds.

,,Maui Wahine,Screeches!,23 Aug 2010,1.0 ,"It's a cute speaker and it actually sounds pretty good for its size when first turned on, but after a few minutes it starts to screech. Even after the mp3 player is removed, there is horrible sound which combines the worst of a blood-curdling scream and terrible static. I don't know if some kind of interference in our home or neighborhood is causing this problem, or if the speaker is defective, but it is unusable. Hope you have better luck."
,,bsull,dissatisfied,12 Sep 2011,1.0 ,"purchased to listen to podcasts in the car and around the home not loud enough with spoken word and at highest volume lots of vocal distortion top it off, cord deteriorated over time by the connector, and eventually frayed such that the speaker is now non-functional (and in the trash)"
,,ctinva,Play It Quietly,08 Dec 2009,1.0 ,"Sounds fine if you play it at low level. Instructions specify to keep your player at 80% of volume. If the music is too loud, or if a song includes a high peak, the speaker stops playing and screeches until turned off. I thought I had a defective model and got an exchange but had the same result with the new one. For reference, I am using it with an iPod."
,,A. Diven,Great!,17 Nov 2011,5.0 ,"I love these little speakers! they are a great product for the small price. I had one of those mini stereo's for when I'm at work and it was just terrible. This speaker however, gets much louder than I expected. Im quite happy with it!"

When I contacted the company I purchased it from to find out about an exchange. I was told to contact the manufacturer, which is not who I purchased it from. After I contacted Quantum, again, they told me to send it back. However I had to do it at my expense. After o sent it back for an exchange ( at $8.00 for shipping) I was told my card would be refunded $19.80. Not only is that not including the tax I paid, it doesn't include the additional shipping it required for me to send back their faulty product. This has not been a pleasant experience, nor a cost efficient one. Basically threw my money away, with no speaker to enjoy my music with."

,,Reinaldo N. R. Amorim,Something wrong,25 Dec 2009,1.0 ,"Something wrong. That is all I can say about it. I got it at home,put new batteries on it, tried and it was working just fine. Put it inside the protective case, that by the way is realy nice, and went sleep.To my surprise when I tried to use it in the other day it was not working, I changed the batteries and nothing happened. After analyzing what had happened, I got the conclusion that when I close the protective case, the power switch gets in the way of the zipper, in a way that when closed it, the power switch stayed pressed for a long time, and that's what I think that made it stop working. In my opinion there is something wrong with it, either the protective case either the placement of the power switch. And all of that happened from the 24th to the 25th of December. Great."
,,LD223,Not what you expect...,19 Nov 2011,1.0 ,"I was really excited to get the speaker, and I was initially very happy with the sound quality. HOWEVER, I fell asleep with the speaker on, just to wake up to this AWFUL screeching noise one hour later. I had just put new batteries in when I opened the speaker from the mail a few hours ago, but I changed them anyway and tried to play music again. The awful screeching noise came back with a vengeance. I don't understand what is wrong, but after reading other people's reviews I now see I'm not the only one who had this problem. Really disappointing."
,,baf10,Very good but with some flaws,29 Oct 2008,4.0 ,"When I first opened the IM237 I was dissapointed. I could not believe that the new orbit was about 50% bigger than the old one -IM207. When I listened to it though they did improve the sound. The new one does have improved bass. While its great that they added a light to show if the unit is on or off, the switch sticks out too far when it is off. This can cause it to accidentally turn on. The could easily have been fixed if they simply had it on when it was out and off when it was in. The second flaw is the cord is the same short lenghth as the old one when it could have been 6 or 12 inches longer without effeting anything. Infact I was able to wrap a 3 foot extention in addition to the actual cord in the bottom. There is plenty space for a longer cord. While I still think the original is a great speaker the new one is improved. If you are on a tight budget or you want a really small speaker that will fit in your pocket buy the old one for $15. If you want better sound and dont mind carrying a bigger speaker get the new one. Its a shame about the 2 flaws which could have easily have been fixed."
,,Krista Oyler,MP3 Speaker,22 Feb 2014,3.0 ,"Speaker quit working after 2 months of minimal usage. From what I can see it probably has something to do with the battery ""prongs"" not connecting to the battery, therefore not allowing the power to get to the speaker."

When the volume was all the way up the sound was garbled. A couple of days later the speaker died on me. It started squealing, turning off and on by itself. Had to remove the batteries when I threw it out because it was turning it self on in the garbage and freaking out my neighbors. Waste of money."

,,LRR,One Star,02 Mar 2017,1.0 ,bad function
,,R. S. CRAWFORD,40% better than the iM-207,30 Oct 2008,4.0 ,"I bought an iM-207 and an iM-237 at the same time, curious to see what the difference was. The 207 is roughly 25% smaller and comes with a 1/8 to 3/32 stereo adapter, is designed to function sitting with the speaker pointing upward or will sit at a slight angle back on its side. I think it is money well spent- compared to the same amount I spent 3 years ago on one of those fold-up cube type dual speakers. In comparison to that fold-up cube, I think the sound is like 3 times better: quality-wise and volume-wise. The iM-207 lacks an LED that lets you know if the power is switched on, so you might drain the batteries out if you forget to turn it off after you unplug your player unit. It turns on and off by rotating the outer chrome ring-not a smooth switch at all compared to a rocker, slider or push button. Now on to the iM-237: a bit more stylish than its predecessor the iM-207 and at a price that is 130% more. It comes with a swanky padded and zippered carrying case with a mini carabiner clip and a tether that can be attached to the speaker to secure it to your wrist or hang it on the wall, it doesn't have a 1/8th to 3/32 adapter. the sound is cleaner than the 207, more defined at both ends and easier to listen to and has more volume. I wouldn't say the sound is twice as good though- I'd say more like 40% better. I'm not an acoustical engineer and don't have the audio equipment to evaluate the quality on any emperical basis. The iM-237 does have a nice green LED to let you know the power is on and a simple push button on/off button (which is vulnerable to accidental activation) the cord conceals neatly in a winder molding in the base and secures the plug well- a little too well, it's hard to get it out if you don't have long fingernails! I'd say value wise the 207 has a better quality to dollar value, however if you prize sound quality then go for the iM-237."
,,sandra,would on recommend,23 Jul 2011,2.0 ,"after receiving the unit after reading many good reviews , when I got it it seamed to work great for about 5 min. then quit, am in the process of sending it back now, we will see how that goes"
,,A. M. Mallett,Not what I was hoping for,05 Aug 2011,2.0 ,"While it wasn't what I was really looking for, I got what I paid for. I was looking for a product that was lightweight and I could use at the beach. This doesn't work well with any wind and that rules out the beach for the most part."
,,RagingBuddhist,Still a throwaway unit,06 Jan 2009,3.0 ,"I could mirror all the comments on here - the on-off button issue, that it sounds better than the iM-207, the better styling than it's baby brother. For all that, I'd probably give this 5 stars. But, for why I give it 3 stars, consider this: I'm a music fanatic who, for years, was looking for a way to take a lot of music out on backpacking trips with a minimum of weight. Enter these Altec speakers (coupled to a Sansa 4 gig Clip). I'd stumbled onto the iM 207 in a local store and really enjoyed it. Great sound, long battery life and small enough to carry anywhere. Then, after a couple of months, I noticed the insulation on the cord was starting to rip right where it exits the housing. There's no stress relief whatsoever. On the 237 it's no different. On the 207, it appears like the wire at least exits the housing on a slight angle as it goes around the housing to lay into the storage channel. On the 237, it appears to stick straight out - something almost guaranteed to tear the insulation in time, even with the TLC I give to all my electronics. I'm about to open the 207 to see if there's a place to put a mini jack so I can solder one in. I see me needing to do the same with the 237 one day. All this is to say, I can't rate any product with what I see as a design flaw as anything but average. If it's destined to break, it ""ain't all that""."

,,cpix 25,"Almost made it to the ""usable"" category",08 Jun 2011,2.0 ,"For a speaker to be effective it has to be hooked to something.

,,New Jersey Mom,"Terrible, am replacing",11 Mar 2009,1.0 ,"I put in a 3-star review back in March which I have deleted, but I would like to revise my appraisal of this product downwards. The most important flaws IMO are: 1) battery case doesn't hold the batteries in; I had to jimmie a solution together with aluminum foil. 2) The cover to the battery case is a pain in the neck to put back on. Six months of owning the speaker has not made it any better, in stead it is more annoying every time I need to change the batteries. 3) There is a lot of noise in the high frequencies and in sibilants. Female voices in particular are very distorted. This morning, after putting up with yet another podcast that I couldn't understand because of sound distortion, I said ""that's it I'm replacing this piece of junk."" Note I'm no kind of audiophile, and my main use of this speaker is listening to spoken podcasts (not music). But the sound distortion is appalling and just too much to take."

,,adam,Very happy with it,13 Nov 2008,4.0 ,I bought one of these to play music from my iPhone during a vacation. I used it outdoors by the swimming pool for about a week. Went through only one set of batteries (AAA). My friends and I were consistently impressed with the sound that came out of this little speaker; it's surprisingly loud and clear. I figured when I bought it that it was basically a throw-away. Not so. It's a good little speaker that fits the bill.
,,Figen,I'll Make My Point Loud and Clear: This speaker isn't loud and clear!,07 Apr 2009,3.0 ,"Okay, so I'm a mild-mannered easy listening/jazz type -- alternative at my edgiest -- and if this speaker isn't loud enough for my taste, you rock and metal and hip-hop types had better beware. I carefully lowered the volume on my iPhone before hooking up the speaker, prepared to have my ear drums blown out as some reviewers had warned, and was pretty much underwhelmed by the volume. Oh, this is not to say you can't turn the volume all the way up to an almost sufficient degree of loudness -- it's just that near the louder extremes, the music gets distorted and broken up. Do you or I or anyone else really need to have the Beatles break up yet again? Yes, at the lower volumes the sound is, I'll admit, awesome for something so tiny. And yes, the design is totally cool and the great carrying case will make this a great travel partner. So for twenty-five bucks, you can't go wrong if you keep your expectations realistic -- but if you want something compact and battery-operated that'll fill, say, an entire bedroom with sound that's loud and exciting, I believe Amazon also sells the Pocket Rocket vibrator."
,,rabbit-light,Your State-of-the-Art Transistor Radio,03 Jun 2013,5.0 ,"Think of this, plugged into your DAP, as the evolution of the transistor radio; there's no point in comparing it to a different class of product. That said, I can't imagine a battery-powered speaker of this size sounding much better, and anyone who's heard one of those first generation of mass-popular, culture-changing transistors from the '50s and '60 should be amazed. It's got more or less even response, a very full bottom-end and enough upper-range detail to deliver most musical styles, including those with a wide dynamic range like classical and jazz. For perspective, It's about twice the volume and has much greater clarity than my Thinkpad's built-in speakers. It will probably compare very favourably to most run-of-the-mill sub-$50 external AC-powered PC speakers. There are a number of new products that seem to aim at this functionality and I've listened to a handful of them and even brought a couple home, including the comparitively awful iHome and HMDX competitors; this product is outstanding in its class. In fact, all that said about class, the Altec Lansing has much higher fidelity than many AC-powered speakers four times this size, including for example the Logitech D100 (the Logitech is louder, but has comparatively poor fidelity at equal volumes). If you're in a studious mood to hear a lot of detail then use a good pair of cans. If on the other hand you want a more-or-less stationary amplified speaker system, there are also a number of better options for less than $500. Even if you need to blast a beach party you might want something different than this. But if you're in the kitchen making salsa, or folding a huge stack of laundry in the basement, or out on the patio with a beer, or playing a board game with buddies, this is perfect. A word regarding the cord. I agree with other reviewers that this part is too flimsy and I don't expect it to last the first year of use. Nonetheless, this part is easy enough to replace with a little bit of solder. I haven't seen many opinions about Altec Lansing's choice to use replaceable batteries instead of the more popular built-in LION/USB charging port system, but I prefer the replaceable batteries: this means that as long as I can avoid blowing the cone, the product should last as many years as the foam surround (a decade at least). A final tip for spaces with a high noise floor: if you've got a player that runs Rockbox (such as the Sansa Clip+), set your dynamic compressor to around 9."
,,Tenacious G,Non-audiophile review - me like,27 Dec 2010,4.0 ,"This is a good, simple speaker, emphasis on the ""simple."" I also have the X-Mini II Capsule Speaker, and I would recommend this over that every day of the week and twice on Sundays. There are some things I would change, but hey, it's $20. Here is my review in bullet form: The GOOD: - very portable - good volume - good sound - fab design (I really like the way the cord raps around and fits in the bottom) - simple - there is an on/off button and a cord; that's it (I don't like separate volume control on the speakers themselves - I'm a civilian; I get confused). The I-DON'T-CARE-ABOUT-BUT-YOU-MIGHT - no volume control on speaker - can't link to other speakers (like X-Mini can) The BAD: - uses alkaline batteries - would prefer rechargeable - cord is small and attached to (i.e., not plugged into) the speaker - suspect that this is where it will break due to inevitable strain on the cord. - no input jack - can't use separate longer/more expendable cord."
,,Amazon Customer,"Love the sound, don't miss the stereo",03 May 2012,5.0 ,"I use this speaker with my laptop, tablet and phone. I'm not an audiophile, but it gives a nice, rich sound that beats the tar out of the internal speaker on all those devices; I can move around the room and hear whatever is playing without any trouble. I thought I'd miss the stereo sound, but compared to most other mini-speaker systems I've used, it's far and away the best, and the stereo sound is a small sacrifice for such a compact unit. I primarily use it for listening to podcasts and audiobooks, but also music and for Skype sessions. I worry a little about the on/off switch, which is just a push button, since I am inclined to toss it in my backpack, and the way it's designed, it seems like something that could get turned on by accident. The battery life on the unit has been very good; I didn't expect it to last so long on 3 AAA batteries; with semi-regular use, the batteries have lasted about a month and a half."
,,jmz,Great little portable speaker,26 May 2009,5.0 ,"There isn't much to complain about this speaker. The sound is great. It's portable. You can sit it up on its side or lay it flat. Currently our speaker resides in our toddler's room as he's graduated to an iPod (an old one of ours), and it doesn't take up a lot of space at all and is perfect for his room. I plan on stealing it some day if I don't get my own.... The cons: It takes three AAA batteries to run the speaker. We use recharageble batteries, so this really isn't a big deal. It just can be a bit inconvenient if we forget to charge the batteries before bedtime rolls around (we've got our boy listening to jazz or classical at night). The wire connection between the speaker and the iPod is very sort. I wish it were long, but I'm sure I could find something as a replacement. It's just something one has to get used to. And yes, there has be a lot of iPod dropping (thankfully on the carpet), but by the parents, not the kid. Otherwise, this is a super-fantastic accessory for you ipod!"
,,Dmitry Kristal,Great sound punch in the palm of your hand.,03 Jul 2009,5.0 ,"The Good: * Virtually compatible for any MP3 Player/Phone: If it has a input for headphones, it will be compatible. * Dramatically increases sound. * Lots of power from a speaker that fits the palm of your hand. * Cord Management underneath the base is nice. * Free case, key chain and string are all included. The Bad: *Uses 3 AAA batteries to operate: If you use it a lot, get ready to spend on batteries. (Batteries not included either.) The Bottom Line: If you have a device that you would like to make more audible, you can't go wrong, especially for the price. However, depending on your usage, you will need batteries. The box claims that 3 batteries would last for up to 24 hours. Some reviewers complain about clarity, but do not let that fool you: Manual clearly states that the maximum sound level on your device that you should adjust should be no more than 80%. In other words, if you will put your device's volume to 100%, it will not be clear. PS: This little guy was tested with a first generation iPhone."
,,P. Mckee,Just what I was looking for....,07 Aug 2009,5.0 ,"the Altec Lansing iM 237 Orbit Ultraportable speaker for MP3 players is just what I was looking for. I wanted a small speaker for the side of my bed, for out side, or for when I soak in the tube. It's great b/c you don't have to plug it in. I have had mine for a month now and have not had to change the batteries. I play it every night for hours. I listen to audio books and don't have to turn it up to hear. The sound is exceptionally clear. Next to the on/off button a green light shows when the speaker is on...no guesswork. For one speaker you get great sound. I listen to a wide range of music. Like I mentioned above it's great for audio books, classical to good rock music. For the price, portability, and the great sound it's a must have. I've bought more for gifts for friends and family. I'm not good at writing reviews...but I had to give it a go on this b/c reading others reviews convinced me this is a great speaker. Hope this helps."
,,$ecret@sianMan,"Small size, big sound, looks great.",04 Jul 2014,4.0 ,"Of all of the speakers of this price range (~$20) that I have tried, I would always go to this one. Sometimes you just wish you had a tiny little speaker on you. In your backpack, in your purse, whatever. You're at a friend's place and everyone's at the pool - if only there were some music! You can whip this out of your backpack, plug it in, look like the biggest nerd on the block for carrying a speaker around in your bag but have loud, good-sounding music pumping out in seconds. Let's make one thing clear - audiophiles, turn away. This isn't your game. No hate - I consider myself somewhat of an audiophile, too, but there's a time for everything and pool parties, grilling on your porch, impromptu card games and musical showering aren't always practical for studio-quality sound. Sometimes you just want something that's compact, portable, no-hassle, and loud - that's what this speaker does. It's definitely an upgrade over 99% of laptop speakers both in sound fullness and volume. It's remarkably loud for its tiny size. It's about the size of a hockey puck with some added thickness, and can be cranked until almost full volume without any distortion. Very bassy tracks, predictably, cause some mild crackling but the speaker seems to handle most inputs very well. That said, it'll be enough for a casual gathering. Not 20-person+ ragers in your basement. I do have a gripe with this speaker, though, and that is the 3.5 AUX cable it comes with. It's the shortest cable you'll ever see, and it can be a pain to store in its underneath compartment or to take it out. This means you can't control the speaker from afar with your device. If this is a concern for you, consider getting an extension cable. I also really wish it ran off a rechargeable battery, but I have found a use for all those spare Duracells lying around! The speaker looks really good. It actually feels more plastic-y than its look leads you on to believe, which is only mildly disappointing because it feels quite solid in the hand. It's overall lightweight and its metal-like finish lets it blend into most decors in the home very well. I had a Velcro wall mount that I used to attack the speaker while I was in the shower. It looked really good right on the wall. But man, if only that cable were longer. In the end, I choose this speaker in the market of low-end, cheap, portable speakers because of its aesthetics, its size, its loudness, and its sound quality."
,,littlenomad,Solid Device,26 Dec 2011,4.0 ,"The Altec Lansing iM227 is easy to use and features clean, undistorted sound. I also own one of the Orbit USB laptop speakers, and I think the iM227 produces a fuller sound. I've been very pleased with both, however. I would give the iM227 a full five-star review if the mini-stereo plug was longer. The short cord isn't a bother when your device is playing/stationary...but if you need to pick up your phone/mp3 player/tablet to change the playlist (or some other setting), you may accidentally tow the speaker along with it! You can get around this by buying an extension cable, but sometimes those are a bit too long. Anyway, the iM227 is definitely a good choice for users who want to listen to their portable audio without earphones, but don't want to compromise on build or sound quality. The only thing missing is a travel case!"
,,Paul Rainn,The Little Speaker That Could...,14 Dec 2009,5.0 ,"Sometimes you just want to share something special with friends, loved ones or family, and it that something is your favorite MP3 tracks then the Altec Lansing fits the bill perfectly! It's primary attributes are as follows: * Easy portability due to its light weight and compact dimensions. Throw it in a backpack, handbag, attache, even attach it to your belt with a carabiner! * Good endurance with its 3 AAA batteries. Based on my observations you'll get 12-15 hours of solid play at near maximum settings. * Extreme ease of use, expecially important if you're in a hurry, or want to share/set up/pack quickly. There's only 1 connection (from your MP3 device to the speaker) and one power on/off button! * Finally, and probably most critically, is the quality of the music it amplifies. Keeping in mind that this is a tiny unit with just 4.5 vots total power, it does very well. You could easily share it and hear it in a typical dorm room setting or small family gathering. Conversely, the Altec has two small downsides. If you are looking for a big bass boost or 'boombox' quality, this is not the unit for you! No amount of engineering could do that in this small a package, not yet anyway. Secondly, the speaker wire does not seem particularly robust, its design means there'll be inevitable wear and tear and eventually that could lead to the wire separating from its attachment point. However, I've noticed that if you don't unspool the entire length but leave 2-3 inches in there's almost no strain on the unit so it should last for a considerable time like that. All told I've found the enjoyment, portability, excellent sound fidelity, and price to be an unbeatable combination!"
,,Katherine Richardson,Everything I was looking for,25 Dec 2009,5.0 ,"I just got this for a Yule gift and I'm thrilled! It is definitely ultra-portable at about half the size of my mother's portable speaker. Because it has a speaker plug instead of an iPod/iPhone dock, I have the option of using it with my iPhone OR my XM Radio. It sounds spectacular, especially given it's size. The case is nicely padded and appears that it will offer ample protection. The only thing I'm concerned about is battery life, but I don't yet know what that will be, so I'll reserve judgement. So far, I am pleasantly surprised by the quality. Update 3/27/11: I've now had this over a year. I am still very happy with my little speaker. I have used it while traveling and at home. The batteries last forever. The only thing I wish was that it was rechargeable. But otherwise I am very happy with it. I don't understand why some reviewers have said it wasn't very loud. Trust me when I say that despite my moderate hearing loss, it is loud enough for me to hear it and think it is LOUD!"
,,Newbian,Surprising sound for the size,28 Dec 2010,4.0 ,"I had experimented with several models of ultra-portable travel speakers before buying this mono-speaker from AL; this was the first travel speaker I owned that did not disappoint. The sound is much bigger than the footprint suggests, and battery life is exceptional. While sound quality was quite good when playing music, the speaker impressed me when playing spoken-word audio, such as podcasts, streamed radio or audio books. It was an improvement on other models I had tested that could provide volume, but not a full sound. Room for improvement? Sure. I'd like to see this updated with a built-in rechargeable battery. I'd also like to see the audio cable replaced with a cloth cable (a la some models of Ultimate Ears headphones) or at least thicker rubber cable to avoid the kinks that typically occur with all travel speakers -- those kinks always lead to severed wires."
,,Tanya McHenry,Not Bad for Such a Small Device,25 Jun 2011,4.0 ,"My first disclaimer is that I enjoy music but I am not so into that kind of entertainment that I would consider myself high on the list of demanding certain sound qualities. What I can say is I find the sound quality enjoyable and ""bigger"" than the built in speaker of my notebook and suitable for a Sony Walkman MP3 player. Despite what other websites advertise, this works with other devices than just iProducts. It is portable, but there are more portable devices out there. The cord is a bit short. I can't imagine why they couldn't include another few inches in cord length. The battery use is good so far, but I plan on pairing this up with some rechargables. The carrying case with the clip, well that's a really nice touch. I would recommend it to others easily. It's a no fuss device that performs well."
,,David H. Peterzell PhD PhD,"It's good. As an iPhone/iPod user, I prefer iMainGo.",17 Nov 2008,4.0 ,"I'm not looking for perfect audio. I'm just looking for something really compact that I can take with me into the field and have a small party. I had been using an iMainGo with my iPod for quite awhile and was really happy with it. But it wasn't so great for use with my iPhone (as the phone wouldn't fit well inside) and at some point, my portable sound system was stolen from my luggage at the Tucson airport. (never mind the security locks on the luggage!!!). I wasn't able to replace the iMainGo, so I tried a few portable speakers and this wheel-shaped thing seemed to be the best. I've been very happy with the sound quality. I'd simply add that it is not as compact as the iMainGo and that the iMainGo sounds almost as good to my ears. I've ordered an iMainGo2 (fits the iPhone) and will switch back to it as long as it sounds ok. I should add that plenty of iPhone/iPod users rave about the iMainGo/iMainGo2... for its sound quality and compact nature."
,,L. Manning Vines,Great for travel,15 Dec 2008,4.0 ,"OVERALL: Great volume and sound quality in a small travel-friendly package. GOOD: See above. BAD: Price, short stereo lead wire and too easy to accidentally turn on I bought this based on positive reviews on the apple store site. Use it with my Macbook/iphone/ipod mainly for travel/lonely hotel stays. The Macbook speakers aren't very loud so watching movies and listening to music is not very satisfying. The iM-237 is probably at least 2x louder and despite the loss of true stereo separation the sound quality is much, much better. Decent low end for a small package as well. Would probably also be useful for improptu hotel room dance parties... The iPhone is capable of higher volumes than my Macbook when used as an iPod, but the sound quality is poor. The iM-237 solves that problem as well. When I first saw this in the Apple store I was very skeptical due to the cheap-looking packaging and the fact they did not have a demo to test out... especially for the price ($39). But now that I have watched a few movies/TV shows with it I have absolutely no regrets. Agree with other reviews about the two minor negatives: the short length of the wire and the fact that it is too easy to accidentally turn the speaker on. On the other hand, case/carabiner combo is a nice bonus... again perfect for travel. I would definitely buy it again and do recommend it to friends."
,,V. Williams,Big sound in a small package,11 Oct 2011,5.0 ,"Just bought this based on the demo from Louie (thanks again) and was not disappointed. Everyone I show it to and demonstrate it for just can't believe this little thing puts out such great sound. Unfortunately Amazon lost out on this one....I happened to look at their competitors and found this little gem for $20 plus $2 S&H at All4Cellular. C'mon Amazon, are you going to let some other business beat you out that badly? I suggest going for the iM237 with the case...from what I've read, the iM227 is NOT a newer model and is actually the same exact speaker with a different color metal top (black versus silver top) Plus the iM237 comes with a very nice case, which you'll want to provide protection when you travel - and you will want to take this with you. LOVE it and may buy more for Christmas gifts!"
,,Sirocco,Outdated - but I like it!,21 Dec 2013,4.0 ,"I bought this model 5 years ago and still use it, though only occasionally, but it now seems outdated due to it’s lack of Bluetooth and rechargeable battery. There are no controls on it besides the on/off button and a battery indicator light. It uses 3 AAA batteries and not being able to use AC power definitely limits it's usefulness. Because of these things it now seems overpriced at $45 – but it also seemed overpriced when I bought it 5 years ago. Probably due to its simplicity has it lasted this long, therein lies its true value. It’s a relatively quiet speaker and you need to be close to it when using it. However it comes with a built-in audio cord (that’s about 8-inches) so it would be sufficient as an auxiliary laptop speaker. It’s attractive but not cute and would look good in your office, it has a professional look and no one will question your work ethic. The 2-tone finish is a nice break from the formerly ubiquitous ""piano black"" finish that attracts fingerprints and doesn't really fit into any décor. I also like how it doesn't have the ubiquitous iPod dock, because I don't have an iPod so speakers with that design feature just don't work for me. I only use it occasionally now but it has potential for possible future uses. That said, it seems to deserve 3 stars, but I still like it and that corresponds to 4 stars."
,,Elaine,"For $20, dang it's good!",29 Apr 2013,5.0 ,"I carry this thing all over the house with me to listen to my podcasts, it's so small. It's right there when I cook or do dishes, I bring it to the bathroom for a shower, I take it outside...It's tiny and really loud and clear. Music is pretty decent on it, but I mostly use it for podcasts. It is so clear you can make out what they are saying without blasting it (which usually distorts voices). I use rechargeable batteries and have only had to charge them once (I have been using if for a month or so)."
,,Doron Avizov,It just works,30 Mar 2011,5.0 ,"Add an inline mic for $7 elsewhere on Amanzon and you have a great speakerphone for your iPhone and a longer cord. I use this mostly for listening to audio books while exercizing and it's nice to be able to answer calls on it with an add-on mic. Sound is fine. Throw it in your bag, take it with you, use it in the car. Can you get substantially better sound for substantially more money? Yes! Can you get a better value for money spent? If you give yourself an hourly wage for research time, no. I've had this for months, using it about 30 minutes a day and I have yet to chagne the batteries."
,,John Nobert,Has longevity with proper care,20 Dec 2012,4.0 ,"I have owned an IM237 for well over 2 years. I paid $15 with FREE shipping from another popular online seller. The price is what initially attracted me. So I bought it on a whim. I had zero expectations other than it would play the music from my cellular device. I had previously owned a pair of Sony portable speakers and was very disappointed with the volume. The very first time I used this little gem I was immediately impressed. It was plenty loud. The sonic reproduction is not off the charts, but acceptable given the size and price. I am a mobile DJ with a $10,000 sound system. My first decent smartphone had a speaker volume that was pathetic. I upgraded it to a different model and was happier. This little speaker was more than twice as loud as the upgraded phone. I have impressed a number of friends and co-workers with this can of sound. None of them could believe that I had paid only $15 for it. I have no issues with battery life, as I learned early on to shut it off when not in use. The cable is a bit short so it has it's built-in limitations (get an extension cable). I highly recommend this to anyone who needs a reasonably priced portable powered speaker."
,,Eva,Spontaneous Screeching!,24 Jun 2011,2.0 ,"Please note: I haven't had a chance to troubleshoot this issue. Overall, this device does what it promises: I'm able to plug it into my laptops, iPad and iPod for louder audio than those devices produce on their own. CONS: - The connection cable isn't quite as long as I'd like. If I move my device (even just by 6 inches), I have to move the speaker. I suppose this is intentional and it might be a positive attribute to some users. - On two occasions, when I've left the speaker plugged in but the audio is off, the speaker spontaneously starts screeching. One time this happened in the middle of the night and the laptop to which it was connected was actually in standby. I'm not sure why this happens."
,,Charlie,Powerful but Weak on Bass,10 Jul 2011,4.0 ,"COMPARISON: Got this after the Satechi SD mini pocket speaker and it is louder than the Satechi but the bass is pretty weak and overall sound quality not as good. The Satechi is closer to $30 though, so this speaker is good for the price (check the shipping costs though you may find the pries even out). This shape of this speaker is likely to be more sturdy than the Satechi. The Satechi takes an SD card to double as an mp3 player though and thats a bonus. Pros: *Price *Volume *Sturdy Cons: *Weak Bass *Slightly poorer overall sound Quality *Not an MP3 Player"
,,Barrett Benton,Voice of the Backpack,23 Jan 2010,5.0 ,"I don't travel all that much, but when I do, and inevitably check into a hotel/motel room, I get rather on-edge about the fact that the only ""entertainment"" at my beck and call is a TV. I pretty much hate TV, and haven't watched on a regular basis closing in on 30 years. No diatribe here: I just got tired of the ""medium"" (hinting at a very old Ernie Kovacs joke about TV being called a ""medium"" on account of it being neither rare nor well-done). If some hotel/motel chain made a point of putting a really-good radio in their rooms, I'd go a bit out of my way to book a room with them. (Of course, a TV is harder to steal...) Anyway...when you're a captive audience in a situation like this, you grimace at first, then grin, remembering the iPod/iPhone/Zune (yeah, I know there are a few Zune-ies out there...right?), and, saying to yourself, ""I don't need to settle for your stinking 'entertainment'!"" The problem is, you only have your headphones/earbuds to listen through, which is fine when you're enroute to your destination, but a bit of a problem when you might need to hear room service or a friend/business associate/paramour knocking at the door, among other things. This is also a situation where you wouldn't be too thrilled dragging along a killer-sounding but not-fit-for-traveling-light ""portable"" speaker system. You don't need Voice of the Theatre(tm) sound on the road, but something at least *decent*, which can also drop into a carry-bag with dispatch, and is totally non-fussy to set up. The day I bought these, I had actually picked up Audio-Technica's AT-SP21 portable speaker system, even though I intrinsically knew that a system based on ""passive"" (i.e. non-amplified) technology would be sonically inferior to an amplifier-based system. Within ten minutes, I remembered the Altec 237, then turned around and returned the A-T for the Altec. Yes, the Altec needs three AAA batteries to run, but they'll last you a while (24 hours of continuous play, according to Altec's specs). In an effort to refrain from my usual long-windedness, here are the key things: - On the road, Mono Rules: I'll always take quality sound in monaural to mediocre stereo any day of the week. (Of course, I'm in my mid-50s, so I actually know something about mono...). The Altec iM-237 is designed on the principle that when your travel requirements are rough-and-ready, but quality AND simplicity are paramount, something has to give. That ""something"" is usually the second channel in a stereo arrangement. But, you know what? When your accommodations are unknown and/or questionable, and your need to travel relatively light overrides other considerations, having that second channel truly doesn't mean squat. In fact, most portable ""stereo"" speaker setups don't offer anything near the satisfaction of even a mediocre, mid-fi home audio system. A much better option is just *one* speaker, of at least above-average quality, with its own amplification for better sound quality, and a size and design that facilitates easy setup and quick stashing away. The Altec scores high on all the above, and sweetens the deal by including a case, strap, and carabiner clip for easy toting - Bang for the Buck: When it comes to techno-tchotchkes like mini-speakers, the knee-jerk response is to go with the dirt-cheap and disposable, because, conventional wisdom goes, how good can something in this category possibly be, and why spend a lot of money on this in the first place? For one thing, the Altec, happily, dos *not* cost a bundle. In fact, at current street prices, it's almost a bargain. Secondly, you get both good sound, smart design and excellent build-quality. Third, the thing is so damned useful, and, for its size, the sound so good overall that you'll wonder how you could own something like an iPod and *not* own one of these, as it extends the player's usefulness considerably. Admit it: whatever you spent on your ""perfect"" 'phones or 'buds, there are times and places where you'd rather not use them for listening. NOTE: Some reviewers have commented on the possibility of accidentally pressing the Power button while traveling with the speaker. From where I'm observing, the button resides in a recessed cavity in the metal top portion of the speaker; unless one exerts an extraordinary amount of pressure in that *one* spot, I would think it rather unlikely that the button would be inadvertently switched on. Verdict: Highly Recommended. Never mind 7.1 surround. in this realm, 1.1 is where it's at."
,,T Wall,"Good sound, small size, and low price",24 Aug 2011,4.0 ,"Pro's: Surprisingly good sound from a small speaker. Easily fits in a small carry-on bag for a trip. Came with a padded case. Low Price (Paid about $13USD on ""another"" website) Cons: Short (about 6"",) hard-wired connector cord that appears a bit fragile No volume or tone control, just on or off. No internal rechargeable battery. Not real load (but see note below). Overall, quite pleased. Only negative is I have to control the volume from my MP3 player (Sansa) and that player does not have a very loud signal. I have to turn the volume way up on the Sansa which shortens the time of battery charge."
,,JWJ,A review from a joe,23 Jan 2011,5.0 ,"I bought this external speaker for my smartphone. My car stereo recently burned out, so I've been using my phone as a mp3 player and pandora. I found out however that on highways it would be difficult to hear over the typical sounds you would deal with. I'm happy to say that this speaker is WAY better then my phones speaker. Heres a easy overview. Pros: -Ease of Use. Basicly plug and play. -Quality of sound (very clear but also nice bass) -Loud (louder then a laptop) -Durable (you can tell how well put together it is just by holding it) -Ultra Portable -Battery Life (use it daily and still on stock batteries 2 months later) -LED Indicator adds nice touch -Cord Wraps into bottom of speaker -Travel Case is a nice throw in Cons: -No Volume Control The volume control is mute point for most devices, as my laptop, smartphone, psp, and mp3 player all have volume controls on the devices. So that part is more so me being picky. As the sentence above indicates, you can use this thing with just about anything. At $25.00, it may not be the cheapest on amazon, but, you get what you pay for. If your considering it, buy it. You wont regret it!"
,,Boston Ted,Good Portable Speakers For Laptop or MP3 Player,16 Jun 2010,4.0 ,"Overall these Altec Lansing speakers do a good job with what they're meant for and how much they cost. I wanted a small and portable speaker that was easy to take with me either when traveling or just having it in my laptop case. I use them as a speaker for my MP3 player, generally when traveling - and the sound reasonably fills a hotel room with decent sound quality. I also carry them with me in my laptop case so I have a portable speaker when I need to show a video on my laptop and need way more sound than the internal speakers on my laptop. Both for the MP3 player and the laptop the speaker simply plugs into the headphone jack and provides good sound. You never have to worry about missing the audio cable for the speaker because it's attached and neatly winds around the base, which is a really useful touch. The speaker takes three AAA batteries and has an on/off switch. There's no volume control on the speaker - volume is controlled by your MP3 player or laptop. The speaker also has four rubber-covered feet so it doesn't scratch furniture, equipment or slide around. It also comes from a snug zippered case that will protect the speaker when you toss it into an overnight bag or laptop case or backpack. The audio cable is only about 8 inches which is plenty for most uses. There is no power cord so you have to make sure you have 3 AAA batteries. I wouldn't consider this as a primary home speaker or a big party speaker - but for around $25 to $30 it's a very good travel/portable speaker for music player or laptop."
,,"RipFilthyFrank,GodOfMemes",Has lasted for YEARS,15 Dec 2013,5.0 ,"I bought this for my husband four or five years ago for Christmas, and it's been going strong ever since, and we use it a lot. We take it with us on vacations and use it constantly around the house. The sound is good--is it professional sound equipment good? No, but I wasn't expecting that, and don't really care about that. We wanted something we could have in the kitchen while we made Christmas cookies and wouldn't be heartbroken if it got flour in it. It has a really good battery life--I think we change the batteries 2-3 times a year, and one way and another, we listen to it almost every weekend for at least an hour or so. This speaker has been great, has really lasted, and was generally a great buy. If it stopped working tomorrow (which it shows no sign of doing), I wouldn't feel like it owed me anything. It was a little cheaper four years ago (I think I paid $35 for it), but even at the current price point, if I could get four or five years out of it, I'd feel like it was worth it."
,,Mark J,Great value in a portable speaker!,16 Jan 2010,5.0 ,"Although I own the much more expensive AL iM600, the little 237 is fast becoming my favorite hook-up device to laptops and Ipods. This mono marvel sounds fantastic given the size and minimum power requirements. It's got a richness to it that makes it ideal for music and voice recordings (which I use it for). As I type this out on my laptop, I'm listening to Dr. William Craig via streaming video and his voice is filling the room as though he were standing right next to me. That's why I think it's the best value you can find in a super-small portable speaker. PROs: Looks very classy - silver, grey and black. Slick push-button ON switch rather than a cheap slide-switch. LED ON indicator. Built-in 1/8"" connector. Terrific sound, given the size. Plenty of volume. Nice protective case prevents scratches. Pretty long battery life. CONs: Lightweight connector cable (not sure how long it will hold up). No way to connect a second speaker for stereo sound. Wish it took AA batteries rather than the more expensive AAA type. Longer cable would be nice. Bottom Line: I don't see how you could find a better sounding speaker in a package this small and nice looking. Terrific buy."
,,Amazon Customer,"Add a little power and, hello sound!",02 Aug 2013,4.0 ,"I purchased this about a year ago and have enjoyed traveling with it. Out of curiosity, I paired it with a FiiO E5 headphone amp that I had laying around. Whoa, why didn't I try this sooner? A little more power is all this speaker needed to go from good to great!. Now I can get more volume without distortion. I'm thrilled with this speaker. Two things would put it over the top, though. A detachable cord and rechargeable battery."
,,John Baran,Buy two for stereo,20 Dec 2009,5.0 ,"First let me say up front I love this speaker, or should I say I love these speakers. Altec sells this as a single radiating speaker and in that configuration it is great. Deep bass for a mini and good sound field. I've paired this up with my sanza fuze, my itouch, my Numark PT-01 turntable, and all my various portable CD players. I collect portable speakers as a hobby so I know what works. This speaker is truly a cut above the rest. While the sound is great, and if I want to travel light I bring one along with me but my favorite configuration is to use two. I run two thru a left/right mini Y split and let me tell you the sound will suggest your home system. Placement is important; they need to be about 2-4 feet away to hit the golden spot. I love playing Dark Side of the Moon or Electric Ladyland to really push their capabilities. My best comparison is to a really nice cone tweeter but it also has the bass below it to create a full sound. When you crank it you can actually see the cone displacement so you know it is moving some air. Single or paired this is one great speaker. The topper is the price so nice you can afford two and cabling and not break the bank. You really can't go wrong. Enjoy."
,,Janet,"If you're looking for a speaker to use in your car, this probably isn't it",06 Apr 2010,3.0 ,"I download audio books onto my Sansa Fuze and wanted to be able to listen to them in my car. As you probably know, there's no volume control on the speaker, and even when I cranked the Fuze's volume to its max, I'd miss entire sections when the narrator's voice would get lower. (Consider this, though: I drive a New Beetle, and it's far from soundproof.) Inside my house, the speaker is great; I keep sound levels just a little higher than they are when I'm using head phones."
,,Kristen M. Woodrick,Orbit MP3 portable speaker,02 Jul 2011,4.0 ,"I received this little speaker for my birthday. I love the fact that it's small, and for the most part the sound quality is quite good. I live in an apartment, and with my Ipod volume at 75% I can hear the music in any room. If you look to go over 75%, it sounds a hair grainy, but really that's me just being very critical. I agree with the other reviewers that the cord is very short, however I don't mind it, and at work it allows me to reach it quickly and lower the volume if necessary. The only confusion I have with this item is the model number issue that other reviewers touched upon. When looking at the packaging, the initial sticker says iM237, and then another sticker is placed over it that says iM227...New or old, for $20, I am pleased with the sound quality and portability of this little device, AND it also allows you to play music from your phone too, which is a bonus."
,,EthelBob,Very portable!,01 Jul 2011,5.0 ,"I needed a speaker to carry around with me at work. I am a housekeeper, and I wanted to listen to audiobooks while cleaning rooms. I have a pocket where the speaker fits perfectly, and I can listen to the book without much interference from the fabric and the volume is great for what I need. The sound of the audiobook is very clear and, although a little directional at times, I can hear it at all times. I will update this if anything changes in my perceptions of the quality of this speaker. But for now, it is perfect. UPDATE!!! It was working great, then yesterday the sound starting cutting in and out. I figured out that something was wrong with the wires. If the cord bends in my pocket the sound cuts out. I am currently working on returning the speaker to see if this is a fluke or a flaw in the design. I shall update again."
,,GG,Wonderful Speaker,03 May 2009,5.0 ,"This speaker is amazing. It performs better than I could have ever imagined. The sound is very good, better than any of the small 2 speaker systems I have heard. We took it on the boat for a week long trip, and it performed beautifully either inside or outside. We did not play it continuously, but every day for at least some time, we never had to change the batteries. Sound is clear, I can hear tones at the end of songs that you can only hear on you home systems. It can easily be put in your bag and transported wherever you go with your MP3 player. The plug-in for your MP3 is self contained on the speaker, and the case provides great stowing when not in use. I recommend this speaker for anyone wanting a compact, ultraportable speaker that can be used either indoors or out."
,,S. Ghosh,Mighty Little soundblaster!,30 Dec 2008,4.0 ,"I bought this product after extensively researching portable MP3 player and laptop speakers,and so far I am not disappointed. I love the sound quality. Pros: The first thing to know before you buy this, is that this is a pretty small speaker. For the size, it does have amazing bass and generally good sound quality. I use it to play music and video from both my laptop and MP3 player, works great with both. Admitted, the sound wouldn't be comparable to a Bose speaker set or even Altec's own MP3 docks or high end portable speakers like iM4 , but hey, for those you'd have to shell out anything between $100 to $ 400. AND this one is smaller than any of those and easy to carry around with you. Battery usage is pretty decent (I use it a LOT)and the on/off light is handy, because it allows you to switch this off when not being used. It comes with it's own neat carrying case, which saves it from the scratches and dings of a rough backpack life. The cord neatly tucks inside the base. Cons: relatively minor. I do wish that the speakers were stereo though, and the cord a little longer. Overall: good value at a decent price. if you are looking for a small speaker with good sound, and are on a sub $50 budget, this is the one for you."
,,AmanduhW,Ultimate 2 year dance party - withstood 2 yr beating in West Africa,29 Jul 2011,4.0 ,"I purchased this speaker as a last minute grab in the airport on my way to live in a remote village in West Africa for two years. I'd been searching for a battery powered speaker for a while before leaving, but couldn't find anything durable for under $50. Though it was overpriced in the airport ($40), I am so happy I grabbed it. This little guy is surprisingly loud - it powered dance parties through out the two years - and is very durable. By durable I mean it withstood being strapped to back of bicycles for 4-day journeys through the bush, has been strapped to arms and foreheads and chests during softball games to provide game music, and took surviving temperatures ranging from 52 to 137 degrees F. Only towards the end of the two years did the sound begin to get buzzy. One complaint: short battery life. But I suppose that's what happens when you blast it at full volume 90% of the time. If you don't want to break the bank but want something of decent sound and durability, I highly recommend this speaker."
,,qbanbandit,"good speaker, cable and case could be better",29 Aug 2009,4.0 ,"We bought this speaker to use at the beach, the sound is pretty good for such a small unit. It is portable and works well with the MP3 player. The case is very handy to transport and store. My gripe is with the speaker cord, it is not very strong and I am afraid it will not last long especially in rugged environment. It seems they designed the speaker and the case was an afterthought. If you leave the speaker in the case you need to strain the cable considerably through the edges of the case to play and the cable does not look very strong. The should design a speaker that you do not have to remove from the case to protect it from the elements. I like the unit but I am not sure how long will last."
,,Mina Brown,"Very nice sound from a small, handy device",16 Feb 2012,4.0 ,"I really love this little speaker. It has a nice rich, full sound in a small footprint. I carry it with me just about everywhere. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I would prefer a rechargeable battery solution rather than having to replace 3 AAA batteries all the time since I use it quite a bit. For the price, though, it's a really nice device."
,,mcs1001,Great Portable Speaker,01 Nov 2010,4.0 ,Pros: -reasonably priced (although would like to see it priced more around $15) -great sound from a small speaker -great portability -comes with travel case -great battery life (so far) -seems wells constructed -takes common AAA size batteries -easy and simple to use Cons: -had to pay a little more than I wanted to -maybe sound quality could be just a little better Summary: Overall this is the only portable speaker that I have owned (which have been many over the years) that I enjoy listening to and can actually stand to listen to for an extended period of time. I also think it will last longer than any other that I have owned...the rest have all broken. Awesome that it comes with a case. The battery life seems good (haven't wore out a set yet but I just bought it). I use this as the main speaker for my netbook and iPod and am very satisfied.
,,oluv,"OK, but nothing outstanding",17 Sep 2010,3.0 ,"i am not sure why everyone is enthusiastic about this speaker. i have to confess it has its looks and even my wife who normally doesn't care did like the design, but that's all. soundwise the orbit disappoints a bit, not because it sounds bad, it doesn't, but it doesn't sound overwhelming either. it just sounds like i would expect from a speaker this size, besides the treble is a bit lisping and it lacks bass. from such size i would already expect a bit more of punch. it is ok but nothing special. i only realized how mediocre the orbit sounds, when i got the chance to listen to Soundmatters foxLv2 Bluetooth Pocket-sized Audiophile Loudspeaker System(Black) . although the foxl is quite a bit more expensive than the orbit it is much smaller at the same time, running from rechargeable battery which seems to last forever, and above all it sounds so much better and mature than the orbit. especially bass response is unbelievable for the size."
,,W. Gorman,Rocking and rolling...,16 Dec 2012,3.0 ,"I bought this because it was ultra portable, inexpensive, had good reviews about sound quality, and took rechargeable batteries, just like my old JBL OnTour, except 3 AAAs instead of 4, and no AC support. Upsides are: lightweight, loud enough to play in a large clasroom, 'bout the size of a mouse so really portable, as mentioned - good sound quality, and pleasant design looks. In short, it rocks. Downside, it rolls. It rolled right off the desk at school, hit the floor, and I haven't heard from it since. I tried to get inside to fix it but really good design keeps the tinkers out. I gave it 3 gold stars for economy and performance, and two white stars for design. How about an 8-sided design, AL? or just an incorporated flat surface, like a flat tire that ain't goin' anywhere."
,,N A Wisser,Nice for the price,15 Jan 2009,4.0 ,"I have to say, my husband loves it. He has a couple of iPod Shuffles and we have no music system in our smaller car. He hangs this speaker from the rear view mirror, hooks up his Shuffle, and voila! better sound than any low end built-in car sound system. A lot of speaker systems work with iPods but not that many work with shuffles. It would be better if it had rechargeable batteries, but all in all, a worthy product."
,,Hilary Clair,Wonderful Sound,25 Jan 2011,4.0 ,"This little palm-sized speaker has wonderful sound for its size. It beats the pants off my laptop speakers, and with its battery-power can be used for my mp3 player anywhere. I am buying a second one, and picking up a Y cable, to get the stereo separation. I'm glad it has its own power switch, and wish it had its own volume control as well. The only other negative is its way too short (7 inches)and far too thin (therefore potentially fragile) mini plug cable. With my laptop headphone output centered and facing me, until I add an extender cable (and/or an extended splitter) I have nowhere to set this little speaker where it is NOT in the way of me operating my laptop."
,,DVD reviewer,"Little speaker, big sound",19 Apr 2011,5.0 ,"A great little portable speaker that works in the car, in the hotel room, and in situations where a dock is too cumbersome or if the use period isn't long enough to warrant a product that recharges your iPod. Our English department bought one so faculty could use it in the classroom with their own iPods, and it's worked really well. It delivers a big sound for a little speaker and can be cranked up to a pretty high volume without distortion, even playing back authors reading their own works loudly enough for all to hear. The only thing is, the sound quality takes a dip and there's crackling when the batteries get low, so you're advised to always have a spare set. If you use rechargeable batteries it's not going to be problematic, but I could see where you'd run through a ton of batteries otherwise."
,,chickey191,great little speaker,30 May 2011,4.0 ,"friend of mine had this speaker hooked up to his iPhone - while we were playing golf. Ok - his play list sucked and so did my golf, but we were rockin' on the course. amazing sound from such a small and inexpensive speaker - which fits in a cupholder in the cart nicely. what I found great was that while the sound was great - it was fairly directional so that fellow golfers weren't irritated while our tunes were playing. Wont fill up a room, but plenty loud enough that we parked the cart and could still hear Led Zeppelin while on the t-box. Bass isn't great, but then it is a tiny speaker. Wouldn't call it hi-fidelity, but I would call it a great deal and perfect for music for more than one person while on the move."
,,Bill,"Great sound for the size, Long battery life on 3AAA",20 Dec 2013,5.0 ,"This sturdy little speaker has surprisingly good sound for its size. Had a couple of play hours on the 3 AAA alkaline batteries before I fell asleep with the unit on at medium volume. Was very much surprised that it was still running strong the next morning. 3.5mm audio cable is a bit spindley so you have to use a bit of care with that. No volume control - you have to adjust volume with MP3 player (generally not a problem in any case. Bought it for $26, Great value for the price. Highly recommended."
,,Carmody Quinn,Had it for over a year - Quality sound in a tiny device,02 Nov 2010,5.0 ,"Shopped all the reviews on amazon last year and this had great ratings so I put it on my Christmas list and was happy to receive it. So - I've had it over a year now and can say it is tough (travels all over with me and has been dropped and bumped around) and it's tiny with nice big sound. I use it with my google phone to watch movies when I'm on the road and it gives me impressive sound. Doesn't have volume control on it and is limited to the volume control ability of the device, which is fine on a quality device like an ipod or google phone, but very limited on a low end mp3 player. This, coupled with an ipod is my stereo system which is nicely compact. No matter what the device this will not get as loud as a stereo system."
,,Brian,BIG sound....SMALL package...,23 May 2009,5.0 ,"Size does NOT matter. In an effort to obtain some type of external and portable speaker system for the 3G iPhone, there are seemingly average options and an equal amount of less than avergae options. The name Altec immediately jumped out as a contender here and I have to say, this thing is awesome! Right away, 3 AAA batteries as opposed to the 1 or 2 in other speakers lets you know that a bit more juice is flowing through the system. In addition, for one speaker to accomplish the range that this unit does is truly impressive. My wife runs an outdoor sporting event league and needed something to put on the table next to the Bocce courts just to jazz up the air. Mission accomplished. Have not yet measured the battery life but I would anticipate that the volume level will have something to do with it. I am prepared for 3 to 5 hours at a decent volume. Also, great little carrying case with a clip to hang it from your backpack, etc. I normally do not review products but this was an exception due to the value for the money. I think I am going to order a 2nd one now becuase I know my wife will be possessive with hers!"
,,S. Pettis,Great little speaker,20 Oct 2009,5.0 ,I bought this speaker on a whim. I was pleasantly surprised when I hooked it up to my iPod. Decent full range sound including bass. The battery life is amazing. I sent one to my musician brother in China and he was equally impressed. I take mine every where I go. It stays in my backpack and I hardly know it is there till I look for it. It also makes a great little laptop speaker too. They just came out with a USB version but I would rather keep my USB ports for other things. After all if you are using a speaker you are not going to need headphones.
,,TMAC,Ok but not what I needed!,08 Aug 2009,2.0 ,I'm a late user to this type of entertainment...I still use CD's but was recently given an Ipod and don't know how I lived without it for so long! My wife and I travel and I thought I might be able to find a portable speaker system so that we could enjoy our music when away from home. This is my second purchase of this type of speaker and as with the first...THIS ISN'T WHAT YOU WANT! The sound is clear and clean but if your not on top of it you can't hear a thing. I'm sure it would and can be useful in a different setting; one where you would only need your volume to be at a whisper. I plan on keeping this unit for those times when using my ear buds isn't the best of ideas but this unit wouldn't fit my need say in a hotel room when I'm trying to set the mood with a little music.
,,Patty,Impressed!,24 Apr 2011,5.0 ,"I just purchased this great little speaker. I had been taking a speaker set (2 speakers about 6"" tall + cords + electrical supply) with me to meetings I facilitate twice a month. Honestly, was getting very tired of all of the items I had to bring to set up for these meetings. I ran across this great small speaker and thought I would give it a try. I was VERY IMPRESSED. For the purpose I needed this speaker for, (playing music during meeting breaks; showing some videos), this has been a great addition! The small rollie bag I use to gather my meeting items together used to be packed full! Now, I have lots of room without the three item speaker set I had been using. Perfect addition to my meeting set up! Easy, no need for electrical... Thanks."
,,C. Katz,Great Value,22 Jan 2011,5.0 ,"Portable speakers are a compromise between size and sound quality. For me, this speaker, which takes up as much space in my luggage as an apple, is the perfect compromise. My iTunes songs sound great on it, and the battery life is outstanding. I am very well pleased with this product, and recommend it highly. I wouldn't travel without it."
,,Radio,Unbelievable Sound,22 Aug 2011,5.0 ,"Quite possibly the best battery powered, single speaker for sale right now. This speaker easily trumps a cheaper brand 2 speaker set. Batteries lasts a very long time. One of these sounds so good, so I wonder what hooking up 2 to an mp3 player, would sound like? I guess twice as nice."
,,C. Kim,Great little speaker,16 Apr 2011,4.0 ,I purchased this for a weekend trip. The volume and quality of sound was impressive for such a tiny speaker. The speaker itself feels substantial and sturdy which hopefully translates into longevity. I also appreciate the protective carrying case as this little speaker will be accompanying me on all my trips to the beach and the mountains over the coming year(s).
,,K. Beck,Displeased with this speaker,06 Nov 2011,2.0 ,"I had this speaker for only a couple of months, before it started having problems. I would plug it in to my iPhone or my computer and it would squeal, hiss, and make horrible noises...even unplugged! I hadn't even used it that much. I contacted Altec Lansing about it via email, and did not hear back from them. I'm calling this week to speak directly to them about getting it fixed. The reviews for this speaker were so positive, I'm upset that mine didn't live up to my expectations."
,,Beast,Tiny little rocker!,22 Jul 2011,5.0 ,"This thing is awesome. If you're looking for a small, portable, great-sounding little speaker for your computer, iPod, etc., look no further than this. The frst time I plugged it in I was amazed and had to turn it DOWN. Something this small shouldn't sound so big - but it does. Hook it up!"
,,Working Stiff,A surprisingly efficient little speaker,25 Jun 2009,4.0 ,"For this price and at this size, my expectations were fairly low for this product. I was simply looking for something that would let me use my iPod Touch in a hotel room, even if the sound was just marginal. But the sound this little speaker produces is competent -- which is far more than I expected. Other reviewers have commented on the sound quality, so I'll leave it at that. Two things that could be improved, and why it didn't earn 5 stars: 1) the supplied cable is comically short -- move the iPod to eye level in order to use it, and you'll drag the speaker off the nightstand; and 2) I wish it had an AC adapter so I wouldn't always have to rely on batteries. It would be nice if, when the batteries pooped out, I could simply plug the speaker in to a wall socket."
,,scott mowery,Great speaker..but someone is pricing gouging!,23 Jan 2016,5.0 ,Great speaker..I use it with my smartphone to listen to music and with my SP7 spirit box..it's easy on batteries but is it really sold on here for 117.99??? It used to sell for about $12 a year or so ago!! In fact I never saw it sold for much more than that!
,,Zach F.,It Laughs At Me,05 May 2009,5.0 ,"I consider myself quite an audiophile, and when I heard about this portable little speaker I scoffed because good sounds can't come from a small package, right? WRONG! You can crank this thing up and it will just laugh at you and ask ""Is that all you got?"" It is amazing sound quality for the size. One minor gripe, when packing it in the case, the power button gets pushed sometimes without you knowing. When I travel with it I just take the batteries out."
,,DANI,Great Speaker,23 Aug 2011,5.0 ,Its nice and loud. but turn the volume to the max and you'll hear a little distortion. but for $20 I'm giving it 5 stars. I recommend using rechargeable batteries which is what I'm doing. Bear in mind that it does not come with a case like other models do.
,,Fernando B.,The little speaker kicks butt!,07 Feb 2009,5.0 ,"I took this little speaker with me to Puerto Rico and it was perfect. Despite it's small size, the volume is great... good enough to hear clearly when you're relaxing on the beach, even with all the noise from the ocean and other beach-goers. The bass is surprisingly adequate. And the interesting thing about it is that the sound doesn't carry so far so it does not disturb other people. Maybe it's because the sound is going straight up in the air and so is not projected like from a stereo. I don't know. Anyway, another impressive thing about this speaker is the battery life on just 3 AAA batteries. I didn't have to replace them for days even with multiple-hour use each day."
,,Joni H,"great speaker, terrible customer service",12 Nov 2012,3.0 ,I bought this a few years ago. I used it for roughly 9 months before the sound started getting dirtier and I couldn't turn it up as loud. I contacted alter lansing multiple times over the course of a few months and received no reply other than an automated email once in a while that said that they had a high call volume and they were sorry for the delay. I like the product but I will not purchase things from alter lansing going forward. They have terrible service.
,,GREGORY T. MIYATA,Little package---Huge surprise,30 May 2009,5.0 ,"The Altec Lansing iM-237 Orbit Speaker is a very good product. When I hooked up the speaker to my laptop and let a Tech Coordinator play music on it, he was blown away by the size and price. He was very pleased with what I purchased which meant that I had to watch it as it might find its way into his computer bag. We were in his office which is the size of a classroom but it has a very high ceiling as he has an above ceiling storage area. He walked all around the furthest perimeter of his office and he could hear the music clearly. Astounding...amazing...were just a couple of words he used to describe my speaker...he plans to buy many to outfit his teachers to use in their classrooms."
,,Silus Cramford,"Great, but use tape",02 Nov 2012,4.0 ,"Great speaker... Really advise taping the input connector. i've had multiple of these and after a year the wire always becomes exposed at the jack and then it's a bit late..... I've had to replace each after about a year. in itself not a biggie at the price, but avoidable with some proactive taping! Eats batteries, recommend getting some re-chargables..."
,,Ukulele Significance,Altec Lansing speaker - a fun addition.,27 Sep 2011,4.0 ,"I bought the Altec Lansing Orbit speaker to connect to a phone/mp3 player while traveling. For its size, the sound is great for both music and voice, and I don't miss it being in stereo. Thus far it's fairly durable, seems not to go through batteries and has served me well. The headphone cable seems short, but it hasn't really caused me any trouble. After accidentally turning it on through a stuff-sack while it was packed in my bag, I've taken to removing one of the batteries while traveling."
,,I. Stroh,Awesome sound for the size & price,25 Dec 2008,5.0 ,"Purchased the im237 for vacation and we're blown away by the sound coming from this little speaker. Sure, you need to be in the same room, but overall, the sound quality is awesome. Any of the negative comments that others seem to have are too minor to be a consideration, especially with the low cost. We played it all week, and still the original batteries are working fine. We have a larger AL dock and love it as well."
,,Movie Buff,Agreed: Great!,20 Oct 2010,5.0 ,Agree w/ all the praise heaped on here. Great sound quality... hard to call it 'mono' since everyone gets a full mix. Just back from vacation where it was great to have at the hotel and in the car. I also had a problem w/ the on/off switch and got a replacement fast and w/ little hassle. You can't go wrong.
,,John Rawkon,Great Sound with interesting side effects,02 Mar 2010,4.0 ,"This portable speaker is really fantastic. Not like the cheap 'tinty' speakers from other companies- this speaker is portable enough for easy storage, but packs a solid full sound. But for anyone who has already purchased this speaker, try this test out for size. Play The Beastie Boys ""Time for Livin'"" off of the ""Check Your Head"" album on this speaker and somehow you have a flawless instrumental version of the song. No joke. I assume some of the 'noise filtering' technology actually removes the vocal track from the song. Other than this anomaly, this really is a great little speaker. Highly Recommend! Good Times!"
,,B. Shin,"For the size & price, this is a great speaker. Helpful Hint Below!",23 Mar 2009,5.0 ,"I've owned several ultra-compact travel speakers, and this is by far the best one. I have nothing really to add to previous reviews, but this: To make replacing the batteries easier, I took a sharpie and marked one dot on the battery cover and one dot on the base so they aligned at the insert point before you turn it to lock. This makes it a lot easier to put the cover back on. I hope the manufacturer takes note."
,,Adan Burgueno,Best Portable Small Speaker,03 Nov 2009,4.0 ,"Pros: Its very sick product, very portable and small, loud ;), very nice for kickbacks and drink or w.e with your friends, great high sounding quality Cons: Major problem with this is that the adapter plug is not very durable, tends to loosen and eventually in a few months break apart from the wires inside giving you sometimes bad quality connectivity for your ipod or mp3, this is my second orbit cause of that. Too Overpriced. It be good at $25 :P Overall, One of the best products out there honestly ;), just be careful with the adapter lol Important Tip: buy Rechargeable AAA Batteries Enjoi :)"
,,G-Funk,"Great sound, poor build",05 Feb 2013,2.0 ,"I was frequently bringing this with me to use with my iPhone. The sound was great - plenty loud and crisp, so long as you don't turn the volume up all the way. Battery life was great as well, I used it on a near-daily basis and was only changing batteries once per month or so. Unfortunately, the battery compartment broke and would no longer keep the batteries stable. This came to a point where the unit couldn't even get power from the batteries anymore. This happened within 6 months of owning it."
,,Lynn Fir,PORTABLE BUT NOT DURABLE,25 Apr 2011,1.0 ,"Comes with a protector case and I took TWO trips with this in my backpack (loose, no pressure, inside protector case) - and the 3rd time I plugged it into my iPad it made a really high-pitched sound that would not stop. I think the speaker is blown. Not sure how this happened, but I LITERALLY used it to play 4 songs before it broke. And I work in the music business. I am constantly playing music from my iPad during business meetings. I have now purchased the Jawbone Jambox which is pricier, but hopefully it is much more durable. The Altec Lansing speaker is of the most disappointing purchases I have ever made."
,,Lynn,Great sound but has a fatal flaw,08 Jun 2011,4.0 ,"I travel a pretty good bit for various reasons and purchased this to listen to my laptop and ipod in the hotel. Anyway, the sound is really good and i would recommend it highly except for that alone. However, the one major flaw -- it's battery operated. You never know when the batteries will go out. Great sound, love the little case but hate the fact that it runs off AA batteries. I used this until it stopped working (a couple of years) then bought something else as a replacement (with an internal rechargeable battery)."
,,K. Brewer,Didn't last long,07 Oct 2015,1.0 ,"I have two of these. Both worked initially, and the sound was great. Over time, both stopped working. The thought was that it was a short in the connection in the battery compartment. I tried multiple brands of batteries. The speaker would work briefly, then get staticky and shut off. Now neither work."
,,Blerx,Great little speaker,03 Nov 2011,5.0 ,"This speaker is surprisingly loud even at 1/4 power. It took longer to open the package than downloading the software and ready to go. Plug and play, Win7 took 30 sec to find and install drivers. USB power, no batteries to fool with. Cord wraps around a groove in the base with a space for the usb plug. Nice storage case included. A huge improvement over the standard laptop speakers, can easily hear it across the room now. Very pleased with this."
,,Shane,Bad Quality,02 Jul 2012,1.0 ,I had this speaker for less than two weeks before it no longer was able to connect to my phone. The cable connection must be extremely cheap because this speaker hasn't moved from my desk either. This isn't the first time Altec Lansing speakers went out on me early in their lifetime too. Definitely will be the last.
,,janehofstra,Great for watching movies on my laptop,21 Aug 2009,4.0 ,"I have a Dell Latitude D630 laptop from Dell's business line. It's great for my needs but not really meant for entertainment, the mono speakers are pretty lousy. I mainly bought the Altec Lansing iM-237 ultraportable speaker to watch Netflix instant play movies on my laptop and it's great for that. I've been watching one movie per day for the last week, as well as a few hours of YouTube and have yet to replace the batteries. It's a good match for my needs and budget."
,,Ken Baynton,Didn't last long.,28 Mar 2012,2.0 ,"I toted this around this house and kept it at work off and on for a couple weeks. Now the green light is red and the speaker sounds blown out, which is odd because i only used it to listen to podcasts, no music. I liked it for the 15 days it worked, but i expected a little it to last a lot longer than it did. Also...why are there over 900(!) reviews for a portable speaker? That seems fishy."
,,Veronica,Love this little speaker,11 May 2009,5.0 ,"I read the other reviews and, yes, the little on/off button is in an annoying spot. But I'm very anal about unplugging things/turning things off so it's natural for me to turn the button off after use. (It does light up after all). I keep this speaker to move around with my iPhone. It's awesome. Move it to the kitchen while I'm cooking dinner. Move it to the bathroom when I'm getting ready to go out. It's perfect. I can even bring it in the car (because I'm too cheap to buy an iTrip). For the price, this is perfect for me!"
,,colomom,cord problems,23 Sep 2011,1.0 ,"I love the size, sound quality, portability and price of this speaker, but.... This is the second Altec speaker I have purchased and in both cases the plug pulls apart and breaks where the cord attaches to the iPod plug. There have been times my iPod falls and tension is placed on the cord, but I am a pretty careful person so it doesn't happen often. With the second speaker I bought a rubber shrink wrap tube and covered the connection point and yet here I am looking for another speaker for exactly the same reason."
,,C. Parsons,Incredible sound!,29 Apr 2009,5.0 ,"I am so blown away at the quality of this speaker! I can't believe how good it sounds, how cheap it was, how (relatively) small it is, and how convenient it is! The only problem is that I use it all the time, and am going through a lot of batteries, so I'm trying to find good rechargeables now. BTW, I did buy the prior version (I think it's the iM-207); that was very difficult to turn on and off. This one just has an on/off button which is very convenient, and there is a very bright light that indicates red when the batteries are low (green when they are good)."
,,Deacon,What's with the price?,28 Nov 2016,1.0 ,I purchased this item in 2014 for $13 and change. It is a good speaker. What's with the price?
,,David,Lasted 1 week,06 Jun 2011,2.0 ,"Normally, I don't take the time to write reviews as it seems that department is handled well by other people. However, I felt the need to do so for this product. The speaker itself as far as size and sound quality is an excellent product for the money. What happened with mine though, is after about a week of use, the speaker began to make a loud screeching/white noise sound after a minute or two of use. This was quite discouraging after reading all the wonderful reviews of the speaker. While it does seem many people are getting good use out of it, I'm hesitant to get another and will probably try out the iHome now. So, purchase this speaker at your own risk."
,,Brooke Daly,I love getting some BANG for my buck!,10 May 2011,4.0 ,"So I just got this guy in the mail today. He seems pretty well built, not too complicated. A little swivel on the bottom lets you replace the 3 AAA batteries that power him up. Comes with a connector you can stick right into your ipod/iphone/etc. So now about the good stuff! Sound wise, it gets really loud for a speaker of that size, good job China! The only set back I can say is the bass can get a little crunchy sounding if you turn your ipod all the way up on certain songs, but then again I can play some dubstep songs (Datsik anyone?) and it sounds fine. Keep in mind this is a $20 speaker. You definitely don't need to turn the song all the way up either, unless you really want it to blast. Overall great Bang for buck!"
,,M. S. Luis,Best portable speakers! Very loud and clear.,03 Dec 2010,5.0 ,"I bought these speakers to put in my bath to play my ipod. I reasoned that it is portable so I can also use it to log around on trips, and also as a substitute speaker for my iphone and maybe laptop. I didn't think it would be loud, but I was very surprised how loud it got. It has great sound quality for such a small speaker. I bought this for $30, it's a steal for $20 well worth it. Recommended."
,,A.L. Routhier,Perfect for my needs,26 Sep 2011,5.0 ,"I have an HTC Evo 4G, and I needed a speaker to give me a little more volume than I can get out of my phone's speaker. This is perfect - very portable (I throw it in my purse), simple (it has a plug for the phone's headphone jack and a power button and that's it), and it sounds great. I use it to play music when I'm teaching the preschool class at church and to play accompaniment tracks for practice for our children's choir."
,,Mariem,It won't be used for another week but I'm pleased so far,19 Jul 2014,5.0 ,Well packaged. Fast delivery. It won't be used for another week but I'm pleased so far!
,,Amazon Customer,"Awesome speaker, and the price is a steal",29 Sep 2011,5.0 ,"I received this speaker 2 weeks ago and I am very happy with it. Awesome sound, decent bass, and the portability factor. I can throw this in my pocket before leaving the house and bring it over to a friends and use it to listen to while we play cards, drink, whatever. Great sound quality, and gets loud if you need it to. I made a sound demonstration using it on youtube, just search for Altec Lansing iM227 sound and it will be the first result."
,,Bouc7410,Big little speaker!,19 May 2010,5.0 ,"This is probably only the third thing I have ever bought from Amazon but it is the fifth or sixth portable Ipod speaker I have gotten over the past year and it is by far the best. Not only does it deliver great sound but the battery life far outshines others that I have gotten and the portablility is great. It gets a lot of use at my house as well as my wife and son are constantly ""borrowing"" it for trips or sunbathing or whatever. Will definately be buying a second one."
,,Mary Michael Bogues,Small Speaker Big Sound,16 Dec 2008,4.0 ,"I was looking for a speaker to hook up to my MP3 player and PC. It had to be small enough to tote in my laptop bag or purse. And it had to have a smooth strong sound. This little speaker is up to the task. Simple to use with a strong clear sound and easy to take anywhere. It does not suck the life out of the batteries either. They last 10 times longer than the ones in my camera. (That may be a bit of an exsageration.) Never-the-less, I have been very happy with my little speaker."
,,hippielife,ok,23 Aug 2012,4.0 ,"It is ok but I prefer other speakers that are more compact and stereo. Nothing wrong with it tho, just a matter of preference."
,,Christine Kam,great sound for such a small speaker,06 Jan 2012,5.0 ,"needs batteries, but tested it out the other day, and really great sound for such a small speaker. Very pleased with this purchase."
,,Amazon Customer,Awesome little guy!,10 Feb 2009,5.0 ,I have owned many portable small speakers and this one (Altec Lansing IM-237) beats all of them hands down. My husband and I were astounded by the clarity and sound quality from this little guy. It is quite small and can fit in the palm of your hand. Diameter would be 3 to 3.5 inches and the height would be about 2 inches. The only thing I would have liked in this device is probably a volume control (it lacks one and hence you will have to control the volume from the mp3 player).
,,Deborah J Nicholson,Makes a good paperweight,01 Sep 2010,1.0 ,"When this arrived I opened the box and loved the look of it and the nice little carrying case. Then I put in the batteries and as soon as I turned it on there was a very loud screeching noise. Thinking it might be feedback from my nearby computer system, I moved it into the next room and still the same noise. I tried playing music over it, and the screeching was louder than the music, even with the volume on full. It is totally unusable. When I contacted Altec Lansing support, the real fun began. Just a total run around, and no help with the problem or even an offer to replace it or refund my money. First they had to set up an account for the problem, but when I tried to access the account it was disabled. When I asked what was going on, I was told they'd get back to me in 72 hours. After 72 hours, nothing. Ten DAYS later I get an email saying the incident has been closed, and they have changed email providers so I have to contact a new address. I click on the link for the new address and explain the whole history of the thing. Then I get a response saying my inquiry was coming from a different e-mail address than the one on which the incident was submitted so they couldn't respond to it. I sent it directly from the link they provided when responding to my original inquiry! How could it be from a different address? And after all this, still nothing about the problem with the speaker. After reading the other reviews, I guess if you get one that works, it's a nice enough piece of equipment, but if there's a problem with it, you're stuck. Unless you need a paperweight."
,,Love to shop Amazon,Great little speaker but question its durability.,11 Dec 2012,4.0 ,"Love this speaker. I already owned one and decided to get a second to give that ""stereo"" sound. The first one I own I have never had problems. It hooks great to my phone and iPod. This new one I ordered had a short somewhere. It would cut in and out, along with tons of feedback. I sent it back. Still using the first one with no problems though."
,,reviewortwo,Great quality for such a small item,16 Feb 2011,5.0 ,Love the portability and sound of this product for the price. Would definitely recommend. My only complaint is I wish the adapter plug was longer.
,,Guy,A nice option to have...,14 May 2009,4.0 ,"It has a really strong, full sound. It is very easy to move around and bring with you. The only fault is there is no option to use an AC plug, it is batteries only."
,,S. Hall,"Great product, no real complaints",11 Jun 2009,4.0 ,"This product is exactly what it claims to be; an affordable, compact, lightweight speaker. I think the sound quality is very good if not excellent for it's purpose (I don't ever imagine needing to turn the volume up much past 20 to get a good full sound). Others have noted their could be a few tweaks to make it ""perfect"" and I think at sub $25-20 this becomes a real steal. So until then, 4 stars but don't hesitate to buy it if you think it fits your needs."
,,Monika Lee,great portable speaker,16 Aug 2009,5.0 ,"I have purchased already three of the Altec Lansing iM-237 speakers. After my first purchase and realizing how amazing this little speaker was I got two more as gifts for my family and friends. For such a small thing, this speaker has a very nice bass and clear sound. I love taking it with me when I travel. I even started using it outside when I sit in a yard. The speaker comes in a nice zip-cover so it is easy to store it."
,,jenkc0011,Great speaker,28 Dec 2012,5.0 ,I bought this speaker as a gift for my husband for Christmas. We had tried several other speakers to work with his iPhone. This one by far has been the best. The sound quality is great and the size is perfect.
,,MukilteoCat,Great sound for such a little thing!,15 Dec 2011,5.0 ,Great sound for such a little thing! I love that it is so compact and yet it doesn't compromise the sound quality. I use it consistently. Love it!
,,Amazon Customer,Excellent Value,07 Aug 2009,5.0 ,"I purchased this so I would have something portable to listen to my MP3 player. Based on the other reviews I was hoping for exactly what I received, a quality sound in a small package. The speaker provides great sound and lasts for many hours on the 3 AAA batteries required. I was very satisfied and would recommend this to anyone looking for sound portability."
,,Michelle D. Soesbe,PERFECT,15 Jun 2009,5.0 ,"Just what I was looking for. Very compact, and enough sound for just me, not the whole office or neighbors. Some say the cord is too short but I really don't see the need for it too be much longer. As for the on/off button turning on when you put it in the case. I position it so the button is were the zipper starts. I haven't had it get turned on yet. Just remember the word ""compact""."
,,Edwin Rubio,EXCELLENT! WOW!!!,21 Jan 2011,5.0 ,Excellent little speaker. Can be understimated by sight but what a powerful nice sounding speaker. The case is perfect and nice but is the quality and power of the speaker that makes write this review. I dont write reviews but this one deserves. I might sound insane but i like better than my bose ihome system. A+++++
,,E. Costa,Excellent speaker!,17 Jul 2009,5.0 ,I ordered this speaker after reading the great reviews it received. Everyone is right-- this is one great speaker! Its small size is deceiving; the sound is loud and clear. It's also great because I can connect it to my laptop and the sound is much better than my laptop speakers. I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a quality speaker at an affordable price. I love it!
,,Shai,Terrible sound quality,09 Jul 2012,1.0 ,"The sound on this speaker is terrible. It makes an awful cracking noise when it reaches an audible volume. If you intend to use this speaker indoors and at a low volume, it will probably be fine provided that you keep the speaker at a distance from your iPhone. If you put your iPhone too close to the speaker, the speaker makes lots of static."
,,Shirley R. Weathers,It's what I wanted it to be...,12 Jan 2009,5.0 ,"I wanted a small speaker that didn't sound like a small speaker. I had found out that was hard to find. I've tried a couple other small form factor speakers that sounded hollow. This doesn't, in my opinion. The battery lasts significantly longer than I thought it would. I would and have told others about it."
,,Bryan Ladd,Very nice speaker,17 Jan 2011,5.0 ,"Very flexible self powered speaker. Going for walks hook it to ipod and listen like a radio. Hook it to my Sony Vaio, and nice sound. (Vaio has lame sound) I use it outdoors, or for the kids on vacation. I dont like to wear headphones all the time, this works nice."
,,Anonymous,Pretty good little speaker,26 Dec 2008,5.0 ,"This speaker is a definite improvement over the iM-207 because of the power switch. The iM207 was a pain to turn on and off with the ""twist"" top; I ended up selling it and replacing it with this improved model. The push button on the iM-207 makes turning the speaker easier and the LED shows how much juice is left in the battery."
,,Rite,Don't waste your money,25 Jun 2014,1.0 ,This speaker worked for about two minutes then died. Waste of my time and energy. I finally found a speaker for my MP3 player and this was not it.
,,Daedrian,Was ok until it stopped working.,13 Aug 2009,1.0 ,"The sound is about what you'd expect for a portable speaker. Ok mids and highs, no bass. Not very loud. You really need to be very close to it to hear it well. Also it has no volume control. The only way to change the volume is to adjust the volume on your mp3 player itself. The cord to plug it into your mp3 player is too short at only 9 inches long. It does come with a carrying case and a lanyard that you can attach to the unit itself for carrying. Overall, I was moderately satisfied with it until it stopped working completely after 1 month of use."
,,Art Vandelay,"great sound, but delicate cord",28 Nov 2009,3.0 ,"Sounds amazing, and the design is great. But after a few months the 1/8"" mini plug cable started losing connection. There was no visible damage, but clearly the wire was broken inside somewhere. I think the built-in cord storage in the back of the speaker ends up crimping it, and eventually the tiny wire inside breaks. Hang on to your receipt."
,,J. Stewart,Great portable option,10 Oct 2010,4.0 ,Use it for my ipod and laptop whose speakers are pretty limited. Great for listening to music or showing others videos with sound. Good quality sound for the size...great portability.
,,cfcdh3,Amazing,30 Mar 2009,5.0 ,Best sound of any portable speaker I've owned...especially for the price! Perfect for travel. I'm currently abroad and just replaced the batteries after 5 weeks of daily use. The storage case storage is a must have and good quality. I will give this speaker as gifts and keep my eye on Altec Lansing for future products.
,,Gravyeyes,WOW!,18 Sep 2009,5.0 ,"I'm always looking for a small audio source for my Zune mp3 player; I've always been disappointed, until now. The sound that this small unit produces is simply amazing.The only negatives are (1) no ac option (battery only), and (2) a short cord attachment to your device. The negatives are cancelled out by the sound. You won't go wrong purchasing this product."
,,LHF,Great Portable Speaker,05 Apr 2009,5.0 ,This is a great sounding speaker. The sound is extremly accurate for a portable speaker. Dark Side of the Moon is my reference CD and when I played it on the speaker I was really impressed. I have other portables with bigger speakers that handle more bass but I won't use them anymore because the sound is so pleasing.
,,Sherlock47,Great,10 May 2013,4.0 ,This is so easy to use and sounds great! I don't know what I was thinking but this sounds good. I will be using this all the time.
,,D. Smith,"If you are a traveler, this is for you!",19 Aug 2009,5.0 ,"I am a professional traveler and live half my life on the road. I bought the Altec Lansing iM-237 Orbit Ultraportable Speaker a few weeks back and couldn't be happier. It is light weight, compact and sounds great. I use it with my Iphone for music and my Macbook while watching movies or doing my online continuing education at the hotel."
,,Steffy,Great portable speaker,20 May 2009,5.0 ,"I just received this portable speaker. The quality of the sound is remarkable for its size. You shouldn't expect to run a party with this speaker but the sound is loud enough for listening indoor, I didn't try them outdoor yet. I definitely recommend this product if you need something portable to listen your favorite music"
,,maggie may,great for golfing!,27 Sep 2011,5.0 ,I am amazed at the sound quality it is perfect for golfing it fits in cup holder on dash of cart I attach my ipod to the steering wheel and the attachment wire is the perfect length. My friend bought one and showed it to me I am thinking about purchasing the case for it. maggie may
,,Simona,Love this lil speaker!,12 Jan 2011,5.0 ,"I had this speaker a few years ago and the connection became bad after a few years of hard use at the beach. The sound quality is great! Just be careful not to pull on the cord too much, that's what broke my other one. I obviously love it, because it's the 2nd one I've bought!!"
,,Marci,Awesome,19 Dec 2012,5.0 ,I got one of these for Christmas 2 years ago and have LOVED it. The sound is awesome. This year I'm buying them for my sons because they keep 'borrowing' mine. They agree that it's great sound from such a little item.
,,Amazon Customer,Screeches!!,16 Oct 2011,2.0 ,"This speaker has a lot of good qualities: it's small, light, easy to use, and the sound quality is good. But, if the audio you're listening to spikes for any reason, the speaker makes a horrible screeching noise that continues until you unplug it and turn it off and back on. Apparently the manufacturer says you need to keep your device (iPod or whatever) set to less than 70% of total volume, but that doesn't actually solve the problem. I have mine set at 50% and even so, if I watch a movie on my laptop any loud noise (an explosion, a character shouting) will set off the screeching. It's incredibly annoying :-("

,,Chris Hughes,Nice Little Speaker,28 Aug 2009,4.0 ,"Product is easy to use, well made, affordable, portable with good battery life, and above all else has reasonable sound quality. I use it on the patio, around the pool, and in the boat. I recommend it."
,,chiefcopper,The Best,05 Jul 2011,5.0 ,Best little speaker imaginable. Use it with my I-Phone to play Pandora at work. Use rechargeable aaa batteries that last a long time. Often have it on for three eight hour shifts between recharges. Has great sound and is very small.
,,JRSCO,Great value,21 Apr 2009,5.0 ,Took the iM-237 on a 24 day bicycle trip across Cambodia and it was great. The sound was impressive and the battery life was better than expected. You can find the speaker on-line for under $25 so it is not a major investment; well worth it.
,,chitown,great little speaker for travel,08 Jul 2013,5.0 ,this little speaker packed without a problem. it filled the hotel room with plenty of sound. I would recommend to you for your use
,,R. Mohan,"big sound and good quality, small package",31 May 2010,5.0 ,"I am very satisfied with performance and form factor. This is not the cheapest speaker, but worth the price.

,,COMer,Good purchase. Work as expected.,02 Jun 2010,5.0 ,Sound is very good. Very compact package. Much more convenient to use than a pair of speakers. Amplification is adequate. Can't judge battery life yet. Travel pouch is convenient. Good value for the price.

,,Gail Bennetts,Speaker for computer,07 May 2012,4.0 ,Speakers work well and a good size. I do wish the plug in cord was a little longer. It's so short that there is no way to hold it when it's connected. Quite happy with the ease of use though.
,,AprilMayJune,Perfect,04 Apr 2009,5.0 ,"This product is exactly what I wanted; a portable, battery operated, small speaker for my iPod. I use it at my desk @ work and around the house. Because it is compact, I can take it anywhere. The sound is good, not excellent @ high volume, but that is not what I purchased it for."
,,James E. Fergen,iM-237 Orbit Speaker - good sound,26 Apr 2009,4.0 ,"Speaker works fine although input sound level needs adjusting so bass notes don't cause sound dropout. Instr manual says to adjust EQ but haven't figured out how yet with my Sansa E200 player. Otherwise, a great speaker for motel room or close quarters if you don't need stereo."
,,F. Carter Smith,Solid Little Speaker,25 Nov 2008,5.0 ,"This is the deluxe 2nd edition of a very good concept, portable and lightweight amplifier. The sound is big and it comes with a nice case. The headphone jack is small enough to fit in the original iPhone, making it an excellent speakerphone, too. Very satisfied."
,,Ltl Al,Love it!!,27 Nov 2011,5.0 ,This speaker is awesome! It plugs right into my laptop and I don't have trouble hearing anything anymore! Well worth the money!

,,J. Lewis III,Awesome!,25 Sep 2011,4.0 ,"Works fantastically. Could easily hear over the sound of heavy machinery, though higher volume drastically decreased battery life. Rechargeable batteries are a must. All in all, a great product that I'd suggest to others."
,,J. Gross,Newer revision not as good,06 Sep 2011,2.0 ,"I've owned an iM-237 for more than two years that recently died and I would easily give it 5/5 stars. The new unit that I ordered however has a power button that is much more recessed than my previous speaker. I'm not sure if the one I received was defective or if they purposely recessed the button, but it really ruins the feel of the power button."

They also take 3 AAA batteries which is a hassle because its an extra expense and it does make a weird noise when the batteries are getting low. My friend showed me this portable speaker called BB2 from [...] and I couldn't be happier! No batteries required, with battery life lasting 4-6 hours. They have a clip on the back of them so you can clip them to yourself and take them anywhere. I would highly suggest checking them out!"
